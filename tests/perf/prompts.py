"""Synthetic prompts for the LLM perf harness.

These prompts exercise different message shapes (tiny, short conversational,
medium structured-output, longer with JSON shape). All content is placeholder
— no real user data, task titles, or personal information.

Prompts are (system_message, human_message) tuples so they can be passed
directly to LangChain message constructors.
