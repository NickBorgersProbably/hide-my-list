# Breakdown Assistance

Assumes you've already read `docs/ai-prompts/shared.md` for the base prompt, shame-prevention templates, user preferences context, and output handling.

## Module 7: Breakdown Assistance (NEED_HELP)

When user signals need help starting or continuing a task, agent provides specific, actionable guidance. Core principle: **users interpret vague goals as infinite and avoid them.**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    NeedHelp(["User: #quot;How do I start?#quot;"]) --> CheckActive{Has active task?}
    CheckActive -->|Yes| AnalyzeState[Determine where user is]
    CheckActive -->|No| SuggestTask[Suggest getting a task first]

    AnalyzeState --> GenerateSteps[Generate concrete next steps]
    GenerateSteps --> DetermineLevel{User confidence level?}

    DetermineLevel -->|Confident| Overview[Provide step overview]
    DetermineLevel -->|Uncertain| CurrentStep[Focus on current step only]
    DetermineLevel -->|Stuck| MicroAction[Provide micro-action]
```

### Breakdown Assistance Prompt

```
The user needs help with their current task. Provide specific, actionable guidance.

CURRENT TASK: {task_title}
TASK SUB-STEPS: {inline_steps or sub_tasks}
USER MESSAGE: "{user_message}"
CONVERSATION CONTEXT: {recent_messages}

ASSISTANCE PHILOSOPHY:
- Users avoid vague goals because they feel infinite
- Concrete, specific actions feel achievable
- The smaller the first step, the easier to start
- Always know what "done" looks like for each step

RESPONSE LEVELS (choose based on user signals):
1. OVERVIEW: List all steps with time estimates (confident user)
2. CURRENT_STEP: Focus on just the next step (uncertain user)
3. MICRO_ACTION: Provide the tiniest possible first action (stuck user)
4. HAND_HOLDING: Extremely detailed, click-by-click guidance (very stuck)

USER SIGNAL DETECTION:
- Confident: "What are the steps?", "Walk me through it"
- Uncertain: "I guess", hesitation, qualified acceptance
- Stuck: "I'm stuck", "I don't know where to start"
- Very stuck: Repeated help requests, frustration signals

OUTPUT (JSON):
{
  "detected_confidence": "confident|uncertain|stuck|very_stuck",
  "response_level": "overview|current_step|micro_action|hand_holding",
  "current_step_number": 1,
  "total_steps": 4,
  "steps_breakdown": [
    {
      "step_number": 1,
      "action": "specific action description",
      "time_estimate": "5 min",
      "done_criteria": "what 'done' looks like"
    }
  ],
  "immediate_action": "the very next thing to do right now",
  "user_message": "conversational response with appropriate detail level",
  "encouragement": "optional brief encouragement if user seems stuck"
}
```

### Proactive Assistance Triggers

Agent should detect hesitation and proactively offer help:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Triggers["Hesitation Signals"]
        Pause["Long pause after accepting"]
        Hedge["Hedging words: 'I guess', 'maybe'"]
        Return["Returns without completing"]
        Vague["Vague responses: 'um', 'uh'"]
    end

    subgraph Response["Proactive Assistance"]
        Offer["'Need help getting started?'"]
        Provide["Automatically provide first step"]
        Check["'Where did you get to?'"]
    end

    Pause --> Offer
    Hedge --> Provide
    Return --> Check
    Vague --> Offer
```

### Response Templates by Level

| Level | Template |
|-------|----------|
| Overview | "Here's the plan: 1) X (5 min), 2) Y (10 min), 3) Z (5 min). Ready to start with X?" |
| Current Step | "Right now, focus on just this: [specific action]. That's it for now." |
| Micro-Action | "Don't worry about the whole thing. Just do this one tiny thing: [micro-action]" |
| Hand-Holding | "Here's exactly what to do: Open [app]. Click [button]. Type [specific text]. Done!" |

### Example Assistance Flows

**Confident User:**
```
User: "What are all the steps for this?"
AI: "Here's the full breakdown:
     1. Draft the outline (15 min)
     2. Write the introduction (20 min)
     3. Fill in each section (30 min)
     4. Review and polish (10 min)

     Total: ~75 min. Start with the outline?"
```

**Uncertain User:**
```
User: "I guess I'll do the report..."
AI: "Let's make this concrete. Your first step:
     → Open a new document and write just the title and your name.

     That's it for now. Let me know when that's done and I'll give you the next piece."
```

**Stuck User:**
```
User: "I don't know where to start"
AI: "Totally fine - let's make this tiny.

     Right now, just open your email and find the original request.
     Don't do anything else yet. Just find it and tell me when you have it open."
```

**Very Stuck User:**
```
User: "I still can't get going"
AI: "I hear you. Let's go even smaller.

     Step 1: Put your phone in another room.
     Step 2: Set a 10-minute timer.
     Step 3: Open [specific app/file].

     Just do step 1 right now. I'll be here when you're back."
```
