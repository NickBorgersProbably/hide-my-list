"""Cross-cutting invariants, checked after every conversation turn.

These are what make the layer catch a *class* of failure rather than one bug.
A scenario asserts what that scenario is about; the invariants assert what must
hold on every turn of every scenario, so a regression in an unrelated chain
still trips as soon as any scenario walks past it.

Every check here is deterministic under a nondeterministic model. None of them
reads the model's phrasing — they read which page was written, whether a
reminder was resolved, how many messages went out, and which structlog events
fired. That is the property that lets a real-LLM suite gate a merge without
flaking.

  I1  no node silently took its exception fallback
  I2  a draft naming a task delivers that task's name
  I3  no Notion write targets a page the peer was never offered
  I4  a COMPLETE turn resolves the reminders it claimed to
  I5  outbound sends are idempotent within a conversation
  I6  delivered text carries no banned shame phrase
  I7  each LLM caller used its documented tier
