## Task States

| State | Description | Notion Status |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Intake | Task captured, AI inferring labels (up to 3 clarifying questions if vague) | N/A (not yet saved) |
| Labeling | AI assigning work type, urgency, time estimate | N/A (not yet saved) |
| Complexity | AI evaluating if task needs breakdown | N/A (not yet saved) |
| Breakdown | AI creating sub-tasks (hidden from user) | N/A (parent) / `pending` (sub-tasks) |
| Pending | Task saved, waiting to be selected | `pending` |
| Selected | Task suggested, awaiting response | `pending` |
| In Progress | User actively working | `in_progress` |
| Check-In | System following up on progress | `in_progress` |
| Rejected | User declined, giving feedback | `pending` |
| Resume Detection | User re-engages after ≥ 15 min gap | `in_progress` |
| Cannot Finish | User indicates task too large | `in_progress` (triggers breakdown) |
| Reminder Pending | Reminder waiting for scheduled time | `pending` (is_reminder=true, reminder_status=pending) |
| Reminder Sent | Reminder delivered | `Completed` (reminder_status=sent) |
| Completed | Task finished | `Completed` |

## Phase 1: Task Intake

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User sends message]) --> Parse[AI parses message]
    Parse --> IsTask{Is this a task?}

    IsTask -->|No| Chat[Handle as conversation]
    IsTask -->|Yes| Extract[Extract task details]

    Extract --> Infer[Infer ALL labels aggressively]
    Infer --> Clear{Task clear enough?}
    Clear -->|Yes| Save[Save with inferred defaults]
    Clear -->|No, too vague| AskCount{Questions asked < 3?}
    AskCount -->|Yes| Ask[Ask ONE clarifying question]
    AskCount -->|No, limit reached| Save
    Ask --> UserAnswer[User answers]

    Save --> Confirm([Confirm with inferred labels])
    Confirm --> Correction{User corrects?}
    Correction -->|Yes| Update[Update task]
    Correction -->|No / Moves on| Done([Done])
```

## Phase 2: Label Assignment

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["Task Description"]
        Desc["Review Sarah's proposal<br/>by Friday"]
    end

    subgraph Analysis["AI Analysis"]
        Keywords[Keyword extraction]
        Context[Context inference]
        Deadline[Deadline detection]
    end

    subgraph Labels["Assigned Labels"]
        Type[WorkType: focus]
        Urgency[Urgency: 65/100]
        Time[TimeEstimate: 30 min]
        Energy[EnergyRequired: medium]
    end

    Input --> Keywords
    Input --> Context
    Input --> Deadline

    Keywords --> Type
    Context --> Type
    Context --> Time
    Context --> Energy
    Deadline --> Urgency
```

### Label Inference Rules

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph WorkType["Work Type Inference"]
        W1[/"write, analyze, code, research"/] --> Focus[focus]
        W2[/"brainstorm, ideate, design, explore"/] --> Creative[creative]
        W3[/"call, meet, email, discuss"/] --> Social[social]
        W4[/"file, organize, pay, book"/] --> Independent[independent]
    end

    subgraph UrgencyRules["Urgency Inference"]
        U1[/"today, ASAP, urgent, overdue"/] --> High[81-100]
        U2[/"tomorrow, soon, end of week"/] --> MedHigh[61-80]
        U3[/"this week, by Friday"/] --> Medium[41-60]
        U4[/"whenever, no rush, next week"/] --> Low[0-40]
    end

    subgraph TimeRules["Time Estimation"]
        T1[/"quick, brief, short"/] --> Quick[15-30 min]
        T2[/"meeting, review"/] --> Med[30-60 min]
        T3[/"project, deep work"/] --> Large[60+ min]
    end
```

## Phase 2.5: Sub-task Generation (All Tasks)

After labeling, AI **always** generates actionable sub-tasks for every task. Core principle: **users interpret vague goals as infinite, thus avoid them.** Clear sub-tasks upfront give users defined path forward.

**Key Principle:** Every task, no matter how simple, gets explicit sub-tasks defining exactly what "done" looks like.

**Key Enhancement:** Sub-tasks personalized from user preferences to create success environment. First 1-2 steps focus on preparation and comfort.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Labeled([Task Labeled]) --> FetchPrefs[Fetch user preferences]
    FetchPrefs --> BuildContext[Build preference context]
    BuildContext --> Generate[Generate personalized sub-tasks]

    Generate --> Evaluate{Task size?}

    Evaluate -->|Quick/Standard task<br/>15-60 min| InlineSteps[Store sub-tasks inline<br/>Present as numbered steps]
    Evaluate -->|Large task<br/>60+ min| CreateHidden[Create sub-tasks in Notion<br/>Hidden from user]

    InlineSteps --> Ready([Task ready for selection])
    CreateHidden --> LinkParent[Link to parent task]
    LinkParent --> SaveParent[Save parent as container]
    SaveParent --> Ready
```

### Why All Tasks Get Sub-tasks

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Problem["The Problem"]
        Vague["'Call mom'<br/>Feels unbounded"]
        Infinite["User imagines<br/>infinite scope"]
        Avoidance["Task avoidance"]
    end

    subgraph Solution["The Solution"]
        Specific["'Call mom'<br/>1. Make a cup of tea<br/>2. Settle into cozy chair<br/>3. Make the call<br/>4. Note any follow-ups"]
        Bounded["Clear, finite steps"]
        Comfort["Personalized comfort"]
        Action["User takes action"]
    end

    Problem --> Solution
```

### Personalized Prep Steps

System fetches user preferences and injects into breakdown prompt, enabling personalized "environment for success" steps.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Preferences["User Preferences Lookup"]
        General["General: tea, cozy chair"]
        WorkType["Social: quiet spot, review context"]
        Pattern["Phone calls: review last chat"]
        Context["Afternoon, medium energy"]
    end

    subgraph Generation["Personalized Generation"]
        Prep["Prep steps: beverage + environment"]
        Core["Core steps: actual task actions"]
        FollowUp["Follow-up: capture outcomes"]
    end

    subgraph Output["Final Breakdown"]
        Step1["1. Make a cup of tea"]
        Step2["2. Settle into the cozy chair"]
        Step3["3. Make the call"]
        Step4["4. Note any follow-ups"]
    end

    Preferences --> Generation
    Generation --> Output
```

See [user-preferences.md](./user-preferences.md) for full preference system documentation.

### Sub-task Generation Rules

| Task Type | Sub-task Approach | Example (with preferences: tea, cozy chair) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Quick (15 min) | 2-3 inline steps | "Call mom" → 1. Make tea, 2. Settle into cozy chair, 3. Make call |
| Standard (30-60 min) | 3-5 inline steps | "Review proposal" → 1. Make coffee, 2. Find quiet spot, 3. Read intro, 4. Check numbers, 5. Note concerns |
| Large (60+ min) | Hidden sub-tasks | "Complete report" → 4+ separate tasks in Notion (each with prep steps) |

### Complexity Signals (For Hidden vs. Inline)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Triggers["Hidden Sub-task Triggers"]
        Vague["Vague scope<br/>'complete', 'finish', 'work on'"]
        Long["Long duration<br/>> 60 minutes estimated"]
        Multi["Multiple phases<br/>research + draft + review"]
        Deliverables["Multiple outputs<br/>'prepare and send'"]
    end

    subgraph Decision["Storage Decision"]
        Hidden[Store as separate Notion tasks]
        Inline[Store as inline steps in task description]
    end

    Vague --> Hidden
    Long --> Hidden
    Multi --> Hidden
    Deliverables --> Hidden
```

### Sub-task Structure

When task breaks down, system creates:
- **Parent task**: Original task description (status: `has_subtasks`)
- **Sub-tasks**: Actionable pieces (status: `pending`, linked to parent)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Parent["Parent Task (Hidden Structure)"]
        P["Complete Q4 report<br/>Status: has_subtasks"]
    end

    subgraph SubTasks["Sub-tasks (Hidden from User)"]
        S1["1. Draft outline<br/>30 min | pending"]
        S2["2. Write introduction<br/>45 min | pending"]
        S3["3. Write analysis<br/>60 min | pending"]
        S4["4. Edit and finalize<br/>30 min | pending"]
    end

    P --> S1
    P --> S2
    P --> S3
    P --> S4
```

**User Experience:** When task suggested, user sees actionable first step + brief summary of full task:

- For inline steps: "How about calling mom? Here's the plan: 1) Find a quiet spot, 2) Make the call, 3) Note any follow-ups. Should take about 15 minutes."
- For hidden sub-tasks: "How about drafting the outline for the Q4 report? This is the first of 4 steps to complete the full report. Should take about 30 minutes."

### On-Demand Breakdown Assistance

Agent must always stand ready to help users break down tasks further. When user starts task or expresses hesitation, agent proactively offers specific approach suggestions.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UserStarts([User accepts task]) --> Offer[Agent offers breakdown assistance]

    Offer --> UserReady{"User response?"}
    UserReady -->|"Just tell me what to do"| Prescriptive[Provide exact first action]
    UserReady -->|"What are my steps?"| ShowSteps[Show all sub-tasks]
    UserReady -->|"I got it"| Proceed[Let user proceed]
    UserReady -->|Hesitation detected| Probe[Ask what feels unclear]

    Probe --> Clarify[Provide more specific breakdown]
    Prescriptive --> Work([User works])
    ShowSteps --> Work
    Proceed --> Work
    Clarify --> Work
```

**Key Behaviors:**
- Agent never assumes user knows next step
- Agent always has specific, concrete next actions ready
- If user stuck, agent proactively offers smaller sub-tasks
- User never figures out "how" alone

### Task Reframing

| User Says | What User Sees (personalized) | Hidden Reality |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| "Complete the project" | "Make coffee, then draft project outline - 35 min" | 4 sub-tasks created (each with personalized prep) |
| "Finish the report" | "Find your quiet spot, then write report introduction - 50 min" | 4 sub-tasks created |
| "Plan the event" | "Grab a tea and list event requirements - 25 min" | 5 sub-tasks created |
| "Call mom" | "Make tea, settle into cozy chair, make call - 15 min" | Inline steps with prep |

## Phase 3: Task Selection

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request(["User: #quot;I have 30 min, feeling tired#quot;"]) --> Parse[Parse time + mood]
    Parse --> Fetch[Fetch pending tasks from Notion]
    Fetch --> Score[Score each task]

    subgraph Scoring["Scoring Algorithm"]
        TimeFit[Time Fit × 0.3]
        MoodMatch[Mood Match × 0.4]
        UrgencyScore[Urgency × 0.2]
        History[History Bonus × 0.1]

        TimeFit --> Total[Total Score]
        MoodMatch --> Total
        UrgencyScore --> Total
        History --> Total
    end

    Score --> Scoring
    Total --> Select[Select highest score]
    Select --> Present([Present to user])
```

### Scoring Details

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph TimeFit["Time Fit Score"]
        Available[Available: 30 min]
        Estimate[Task: 25 min]
        Available --> Calc1{Fits?}
        Estimate --> Calc1
        Calc1 -->|Yes, buffer OK| T1["1.0"]
        Calc1 -->|Tight| T2["0.5"]
        Calc1 -->|Too long| T3["0.0"]
    end

    subgraph MoodMatch["Mood Match Score"]
        UserMood[User: tired]
        TaskType[Task: independent]
        UserMood --> Calc2{Match?}
        TaskType --> Calc2
        Calc2 -->|Perfect| M1["1.0"]
        Calc2 -->|Neutral| M2["0.5"]
        Calc2 -->|Mismatch| M3["0.0"]
    end
```

### Mood to Work Type Matching

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Mood to Work Type Affinity
    x-axis Low Match --> High Match
    y-axis Low Energy --> High Energy
    quadrant-1 Creative Tasks
    quadrant-2 Focus Tasks
    quadrant-3 Independent Tasks
    quadrant-4 Social Tasks
    "Tired User": [0.2, 0.2]
    "Focused User": [0.8, 0.7]
    "Creative User": [0.7, 0.8]
    "Social User": [0.8, 0.6]
```

## Phase 4: Task Execution

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Task Presented" as Presented
    state "Decision Point" as Decision
    state "Working" as Working
    state "Step Completed" as StepDone
    state "Completion Check" as Check

    [*] --> Presented
    Presented --> Decision

    Decision --> Working: Accept
    Decision --> Rejected: Reject

    Working --> StepDone: User completes a step
    Working --> Check: User signals done (all steps)
    Working --> Interrupted: User needs to switch

    StepDone --> Working: Continue to next step
    StepDone --> Check: Final step done

    Check --> Completed: Confirmed done
    Check --> Working: Need more time

    Interrupted --> Pending: Task returned to queue
    Rejected --> Alternative: Get new suggestion
    Alternative --> Presented

    Completed --> [*]
```

### Step Completion and `steps_completed` Tracking

When user completes a sub-step (inline or sub-task), system increments `steps_completed` and checks whether to fire first-step reward.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    StepDone([User completes a step]) --> Increment[Increment steps_completed]
    Increment --> CheckFirst{steps_completed == 1?}

    CheckFirst -->|Yes| FirstStepReward["First-step reward:<br/>#quot;First step down. You're rolling.#quot;"]
    CheckFirst -->|No| Encourage["Brief encouragement:<br/>#quot;Nice, keep going.#quot;"]

    FirstStepReward --> UpdateNotion[Update steps_completed in Notion]
    Encourage --> UpdateNotion

    UpdateNotion --> MoreSteps{More steps remaining?}

    MoreSteps -->|Yes| NextStep[Present next step]
    MoreSteps -->|No| Complete([Mark task completed])

    NextStep --> Working([User continues working])
```

> **First-Step Rewards:** Completing first step = critical momentum point for ADHD brains. Reward lighter than task completion but acknowledges progress: "First step down. You're rolling." Bridges gap between initiation reward (accepting) and completion celebration.

### Step Tracking Examples

| Scenario | `steps_completed` | Reward Triggered |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| User accepts task | 0 | Initiation reward |
| User finishes step 1 | 0 → 1 | **First-step reward** |
| User finishes step 2 | 1 → 2 | Brief encouragement |
| User finishes step 3 (last) | 2 → 3 | Completion reward |
| User hits CANNOT_FINISH after step 2 | 2 (preserved) | — (progress noted) |

### Task Initiation Rewards

When user accepts task, system provides brief **initiation reward** acknowledging starting is hardest part.

> **Task Initiation Rewards:** Starting harder than finishing for ADHD brains. Acceptance triggers brief acknowledgment: "You're in. That's the hardest part." Lighter than completion celebrations — encouragement, not party.

## Phase 5: Check-In Follow-Up

After acceptance, agent records timing metadata and (optionally) relies on OpenClaw cron to prompt follow-ups. No browser timer exists.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Accept([User accepts task]) --> InitReward["Initiation reward:<br/>#quot;You're in. That's the hardest part.#quot;"]
    InitReward --> SetStarted[Set Notion `Started At`]
    SetStarted --> InitSteps[Initialize `steps_completed = 0`]
    InitSteps --> RecordState[Write to state.json:<br/>active_task + check_in_due_at]
    RecordState --> Wait[Await cron trigger / user updates]

    Wait --> TimerFires{check_in_due_at reached?}
    Wait --> UserDone["User says #quot;Done!#quot;"]
    Wait --> StepDone[User completes a sub-step]

    StepDone --> IncrSteps[Increment `steps_completed`]
    IncrSteps --> IsFirst{steps_completed == 1?}
    IsFirst -->|Yes| FirstReward["First-step reward:<br/>#quot;First step down. You're rolling.#quot;"]
    IsFirst -->|No| Brief[Brief encouragement]
    FirstReward --> Wait
    Brief --> Wait

    UserDone --> ClearState[Clear active_task from state.json]
    ClearState --> Complete([Mark completed])

    TimerFires --> CheckConfigured{Check-in cron configured?}
    CheckConfigured -->|No| Skip[Log CHECK_IN_SKIPPED, keep waiting]
    CheckConfigured -->|Yes| ConfirmStatus{Task still `in_progress`?}

    ConfirmStatus -->|No| Cleanup[Clear state.json, exit]
    ConfirmStatus -->|Yes| AskUser["How's [task] going?"]

    AskUser --> Response{User response}

    Response --> Done["Done!"]
    Response --> Working["Still working"]
    Response --> Distracted["Got distracted"]
    Response --> NeedMore["Need more time"]
    Response --> Abandon["Want to stop"]

    Done --> Complete
    Working --> ResetHalf[Set next due = now + estimate×0.5;<br/>increment count]
    Distracted --> Decide{Continue task?}
    NeedMore --> AskHow["Ask: How much longer?"]
    Abandon --> ReturnQueue[Return to pending, clear state]

    Decide -->|Yes| ResetHalf
    Decide -->|No| ReturnQueue

    AskHow --> UpdateDue[Set next due = now + user time×1.25;<br/>increment count]
    ResetHalf --> Wait2[Await next cron trigger]
    UpdateDue --> Wait2

    Wait2 --> CheckCount{check_in_count ≥ 3?}
    CheckCount -->|Yes| Gentle["Gentle nudge:<br/>Maybe take a break?"] --> ReturnQueue
    CheckCount -->|No| Wait
```

### Check-In Timing Examples

| Time Estimate | First Check-In (state.json) | Second Check-In | Third Check-In |
|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 15 min | Started At + 18.75 min | +7.5 min | +3.75 min |
| 30 min | Started At + 37.5 min | +15 min | +7.5 min |
| 60 min | Started At + 75 min | +30 min | +15 min |
| 120 min | Started At + 150 min | +60 min | +30 min |

### Check-In Response Handling

| Response | Action | Timer |
|----------|--------|-------|
| "Done!" | Mark completed; clear state | N/A |
| "Still working" | Encourage; increment count | Set `check_in_due_at = now + estimate × 0.5` |
| "Got distracted" (continue) | Gentle nudge | Same as still working |
| "Got distracted" (stop) | Return to queue | Clear |
| "Need X more minutes" | Acknowledge | Set `check_in_due_at = now + X × 1.25` |
| "Want to stop" | Return to queue | Clear |

### Maximum Check-Ins

System limits check-ins to 3 per task session to avoid nagging:

1. **1st check-in**: Friendly inquiry
2. **2nd check-in**: Brief follow-up
3. **3rd check-in**: Suggest break, stop checking in

If user returns and re-accepts same task, check-in count resets when `state.json.active_task` recreated.

## Phase 6: Rejection Handling

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Reject([User rejects task]) --> Why{Ask why}

    Why --> Timing["Takes too long"]
    Why --> Mood["Not in the mood"]
    Why --> Blocked["Waiting on something"]
    Why --> Done["Already done"]
    Why --> Other["Just not feeling it"]

    Timing --> UpdateTime[Adjust time estimate]
    Mood --> RecordMood[Record mood mismatch]
    Blocked --> MarkBlocked[Mark as blocked]
    Done --> Complete[Mark completed]
    Other --> IncrementReject[Increment rejection count]

    UpdateTime --> FindAlt[Find alternative]
    RecordMood --> FindAlt
    IncrementReject --> FindAlt

    MarkBlocked --> Retry([Return to queue])
    Complete --> Celebrate([Celebrate completion])
    FindAlt --> Present([Present new task])
```

**Rejection Scoring Impact** (see [notion-schema.md](notion-schema.md#rejectioncount-number) for full details):
- 0 rejections: No penalty
- 1-2 rejections: -0.05 from score
- 3+ rejections: -0.10 from score

### Rejection Learning

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Pattern["Pattern Detection"]
        R1[3+ rejections<br/>same work type] --> Learn1[Lower work type<br/>affinity for time of day]
        R2[Rejected when<br/>user said 'tired'] --> Learn2[Increase energy<br/>requirement]
        R3[Time estimate<br/>mismatch] --> Learn3[Adjust estimate<br/>multiplier]
    end

    subgraph Action["Action Taken"]
        Learn1 --> A1[Avoid suggesting<br/>focus work at night]
        Learn2 --> A2[Only suggest<br/>low-energy tasks]
        Learn3 --> A3[Multiply estimates<br/>by 1.2x]
    end
```

## Phase 5.1: Resume Detection

When user returns after stepping away while task is `in_progress`, system detects **resume event** and provides encouragement. Re-engaging after break is psychologically harder than starting fresh — system explicitly acknowledges this.

### Single Trigger Model

Resume detection uses **single gate** — all conditions must be met simultaneously. No alternate trigger paths or override mechanisms.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Msg([User sends message]) --> HasInProgress{Any task with<br/>status = in_progress?}

    HasInProgress -->|No| NoResume([No resume detection])
    HasInProgress -->|Yes| CheckGap{Last user message<br/>≥ 15 minutes ago?}

    CheckGap -->|No, < 15 min| NoResume
    CheckGap -->|Yes, ≥ 15 min| CheckDupe{Resume already<br/>recorded for this gap?}

    CheckDupe -->|Yes| NoResume
    CheckDupe -->|No| CheckDuration{How long was<br/>the gap?}

    CheckDuration -->|15 min – 24 hours| ResumeDetected([Resume detected])
    CheckDuration -->|> 24 hours| AskConfirm([Ask: continue or abandon?])
```

**Why single gate:** Multi-signal approaches with bypass conditions produce contradictory edge cases. Every resume goes through identical conditions to keep behavior predictable.

### Trigger Conditions (ALL required)

| # | Condition | Source | Rationale |
|---|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | At least one task has `status = in_progress` | Notion query | No resume without active work |
| 2 | Gap ≥ 15 minutes since last user message | Conversation platform timestamp | Filters normal pauses (bathroom, snack, quick interruption) |
| 3 | No resume already recorded for this gap | `last_resumed_at` field | Prevents duplicate detection within same re-engagement |

**What about session boundaries and explicit phrases?**
- New conversation session naturally involves time gap — if ≥ 15 min, resume fires. If not, no resume needed (user barely left).
- Phrases like "I'm back" or "resuming" treated as normal messages. If after 15+ min gap, resume fires. System doesn't parse intent — gap speaks for itself.

### Gap Duration Behavior

| Gap Duration | Behavior | Rationale |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| < 15 minutes | No action | Normal pause — bathroom, snack, quick interruption |
| 15 min – 4 hours | Resume detected, brief encouragement | Standard break — user likely remembers context |
| 4 – 24 hours | Resume detected, state reminder | Extended break — remind user where they left off |
| > 24 hours | Confirmation prompt: "Still working on X, or should we put it back?" | Stale task — user may have moved on mentally |

### Resume Response Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ResumeDetected([Resume detected]) --> RecordResume[Increment resume_count<br/>Set last_resumed_at<br/>Log to progress_notes]

    RecordResume --> GapLength{Gap duration?}

    GapLength -->|15 min – 4 hours| Brief["Brief encouragement +<br/>resume reward"]
    GapLength -->|4 – 24 hours| Remind["State reminder:<br/>steps completed, where left off +<br/>resume reward"]

    Brief --> ResetCheckins[Reset check-in count to 0<br/>Set new check-in due time]
    Remind --> ResetCheckins

    ResetCheckins --> Continue([User continues working])
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    LongGap([Gap > 24 hours]) --> Ask["Still working on [task],<br/>or should we put it back?"]

    Ask --> UserChoice{User response}

    UserChoice -->|Continue| RecordResume[Record resume +<br/>state reminder +<br/>resume reward]
    UserChoice -->|Abandon| ReturnPending[Set status → pending<br/>Log gap in progress_notes]

    RecordResume --> ResetCheckins[Reset check-in count<br/>Set new check-in due time]
    ResetCheckins --> Continue([User continues])
    ReturnPending --> Done([Task returned to queue])
```

### Resume Rewards

Resume rewards are **light-medium intensity** — heavier than initiation rewards (re-starting harder than starting) but lighter than completion rewards.

| Resume # | Message Examples | Intensity |

### State Restoration on Resume

When resume fires, system restores task context:

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Increment `resume_count` | Track pattern for rewards and analytics |
| Set `last_resumed_at` to now | De-duplication guard for this gap |
| Append to `progress_notes`: `[timestamp] Resumed (gap: Xm)` | Internal audit trail |
| Reset check-in count to 0 | Fresh check-in cycle after break |
| Set new check-in due time (based on remaining estimate) | Proactive follow-up without stale timers |
| Remind user of `steps_completed` and last progress note | Help user regain context (4+ hour gaps only) |

### De-duplication Guards

**Problem:** Without guards, resume could fire multiple times for same gap — e.g., user sends several messages quickly after returning.

**Solution:** `last_resumed_at` timestamp acts as de-duplication key.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    GapDetected{Gap ≥ 15 min?} -->|Yes| CheckLastResume{last_resumed_at<br/>within this gap?}

    CheckLastResume -->|"last_resumed_at is before<br/>the gap started"| Fire[Resume fires ✓]
    CheckLastResume -->|"last_resumed_at is after<br/>the gap started"| Skip[Already recorded ✗]

    Fire --> UpdateField[Set last_resumed_at = now]
```

**Concrete example:**
1. User sends message at 10:00
2. User goes silent
3. User returns at 10:30 — gap 30 min, `last_resumed_at` null or before 10:00 → **resume fires**, sets `last_resumed_at = 10:30`
4. User sends message at 10:31 — gap from 10:30 is 1 min → **no resume** (gap < 15 min)
5. User goes silent again
6. User returns at 11:15 — gap 44 min from 10:31, `last_resumed_at` is 10:30 (before 10:31) → **resume fires again**

### Multiple In-Progress Tasks

If more than one task has `status = in_progress` when resume fires:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    ResumeDetected([Resume detected]) --> CountTasks{How many<br/>in_progress tasks?}

    CountTasks -->|1 task| SingleResume[Resume that task directly]
    CountTasks -->|2+ tasks| AskUser["Which one are you<br/>picking back up?<br/>• Task A<br/>• Task B<br/>• Neither — suggest something new"]

    AskUser --> UserPicks{User choice}
    UserPicks -->|Task A or B| ResumeChosen[Resume chosen task]
    UserPicks -->|Neither| ReturnAll[Return all to pending<br/>Enter task selection]

    SingleResume --> ResumeFlow([Normal resume flow])
    ResumeChosen --> ResumeFlow
```

**Rules for multiple in-progress tasks:**
- Resume reward fires **once** (per session), not once per task
- User chooses which task to resume — system does not auto-select
- Unchosen tasks remain `in_progress` (user may resume later)
- If user says "neither," all in-progress tasks return to `pending`

### False-Positive Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation | Why It Works |
|------|------------|--------------|
| Micro-breaks (< 15 min) trigger resume | 15-minute floor | Filters bathroom breaks, snack runs, quick interruptions |
| Stale tasks auto-resume after days | >24h confirmation prompt | User explicitly confirms intent to continue |
| Duplicate resume for same gap | `last_resumed_at` de-dup guard | One resume per inactivity gap |
| Multiple tasks get separate resume rewards | Single reward per session return | One acknowledgment regardless of task count |
| Unearned reward from false detection | Light-medium intensity only | Resume rewards are encouragement, not celebration — low blast radius if wrong |

### Notion Field Requirements

Resume detection requires these fields on each task:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `resume_count` | number | Running total of resume events (existing) |
| `last_resumed_at` | date | Timestamp of most recent resume detection (new) |
| `progress_notes` | rich_text | Append-only log including resume entries (existing) |
| `started_at` | date | When task was accepted (existing) |
| `steps_completed` | number | For context restoration on resume (existing) |

## Phase 5.5: Cannot Finish (Re-breakdown)

When user indicates they cannot finish, system gathers progress and creates new sub-tasks for remaining work.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Working([User working on task]) --> CannotFinish["User: 'This is too big'"]
    CannotFinish --> AskProgress[AI asks what was accomplished]
    AskProgress --> UserResponds[User describes progress]
    UserResponds --> Analyze[Analyze remaining work]
    Analyze --> CreateNew[Create sub-tasks for remainder]
    CreateNew --> UpdateParent[Update parent task progress]
    UpdateParent --> OfferNext[Offer next manageable piece]
    OfferNext --> Continue([Continue with smaller task])
```

### Progress Gathering

AI must always ask what user accomplished before breaking down remaining work:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant N as Notion

    U->>AI: "I can't finish this"
    AI->>U: "No worries - what did you get done?"
    U->>AI: "I outlined it and wrote the intro"

    Note over AI: Progress: outline + intro done<br/>Remaining: body + conclusion + edit

    AI->>N: Update task with progress notes
    AI->>N: Create sub-tasks for remainder (hidden)

    AI->>U: "Nice progress! Ready to tackle the body section? About 45 min."
```

### Re-breakdown Rules

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| First CANNOT_FINISH | Ask progress → Break into 3-5 sub-tasks |
| Second CANNOT_FINISH | Break current sub-task into 2-3 smaller pieces |
| Third+ CANNOT_FINISH | Ask what specific part blocks → Create atomic tasks |

### Learning from Cannot Finish

Each CANNOT_FINISH teaches system:
- Original time estimates may be too aggressive
- Task scope underestimated
- Future similar tasks should be pre-broken

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Signal["CANNOT_FINISH Signal"]
        CF[Task too large]
    end

    subgraph Learning["System Learning"]
        L1[Increase time estimates<br/>for similar tasks]
        L2[Lower complexity threshold<br/>for auto-breakdown]
        L3[Remember task patterns<br/>that need breakdown]
    end

    CF --> L1
    CF --> L2
    CF --> L3
```

## Phase 6: Task Completion

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Done(["User: #quot;Done!#quot;"]) --> Update[Update Notion status]
    Update --> Reward[Trigger Reward Engine]

    Reward --> Calculate[Calculate intensity score]
    Calculate --> Deliver[Deliver rewards in parallel]

    subgraph RewardDelivery["Reward Delivery"]
        Emoji[Emoji celebration]
        AIImage[Single MEDIA image attachment]
        Music[Play music via home audio]
        TextSO[Text significant other]
    end

    Deliver --> Emoji
    Deliver --> AIImage
    Deliver --> Music
    Deliver --> TextSO

    Deliver --> Feedback{Ask for feedback?}

    Feedback -->|Optional| HowFelt["How did that feel?"]
    Feedback -->|Skip| Summary

    HowFelt --> Easier["Easier than expected"]
    HowFelt --> Right["About right"]
    HowFelt --> Harder["Harder than expected"]

    Easier --> AdjustDown[Lower time estimate]
    Right --> NoChange[Keep estimate]
    Harder --> AdjustUp[Increase time estimate]

    AdjustDown --> Summary[Session Summary]
    NoChange --> Summary
    AdjustUp --> Summary

    Summary --> Prompt{Continue?}
    Prompt -->|Yes| NextTask([Get another task])
    Prompt -->|No| Outing{High intensity?}
    Outing -->|Yes| SuggestOuting[Suggest fun outing]
    Outing -->|No| End([End session])
    SuggestOuting --> End
```

### Reward Intensity Scaling

| Trigger | Intensity | Rewards Activated |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Initiation only | Lightest | Brief encouragement, no image |
| Quick task (< 15 min) | Low | 1-2 emoji + single `MEDIA:` image attachment (gentle theme) |
| Standard task | Medium | 2-4 emoji + single `MEDIA:` image attachment (enthusiastic theme) |
| Focus/difficult task | High | 4-6 emoji + single `MEDIA:` image attachment (majestic theme) + Music + Text SO |
| Parent task complete | Epic | 6+ emoji + single `MEDIA:` image attachment (cosmic theme) + Music + Text SO + Outing |
| All tasks cleared | Epic | Maximum celebration + single `MEDIA:` image attachment + Music + Text SO + Outing |

## Phase 7: Scheduled Reminder Delivery

Reminder tasks follow separate lifecycle from normal tasks. Not surfaced through task selection. Primary delivery is a per-reminder one-shot OpenClaw cron registered at intake; the recurring `reminder-check` cron + handoff file is a safety net for missed fires.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Intake([User: Remind me at 6pm PT to email Melanie]) --> Detect[AI detects reminder intent]
    Detect --> Parse[Parse time + timezone]
    Parse --> Save[Save to Notion with is_reminder=true]
    Save --> RegisterCron[Same intake turn:<br/>openclaw cron add reminder-page_id<br/>kind=at, deleteAfterRun=true]
    RegisterCron --> Wait[Task waits until remind_at]

    Wait --> OneShot{One-shot fires<br/>at remind_at?}
    OneShot -->|Yes| OneShotRun[One-shot agent turn:<br/>get-page → message → state → complete-reminder]
    OneShot -->|No fire<br/>registration failed,<br/>gateway down,<br/>etc.| SafetyNet[reminder-check 30-min poll<br/>finds row still Pending]
    SafetyNet --> Handoff[check-reminders.sh writes<br/>.reminder-signal handoff]
    Handoff --> SafetyDeliver{Delivery path}
    SafetyDeliver -->|User interacts:<br/>AGENTS.md step 6| Send
    SafetyDeliver -->|Delivery sweep / Heartbeat: Check 1| Send

    OneShotRun --> Send[Deliver reminder]

    Send --> Context[Write recent_outbound context]
    Context --> Complete[Mark Completed +<br/>reminder_status=sent]

    Complete --> Done([Done])
```

### Reminder vs. Normal Task

| Property | Normal Task | Reminder Task |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Selection | User requests → AI suggests | Per-reminder one-shot cron (`reminder-<page_id>`, `kind: at`) fires at exact `remind_at`; recurring `reminder-check` poll + heartbeat / main-session startup check is the safety net for unfired one-shots |
| Lifecycle | Pending → In Progress → Completed | Pending → Completed (`Reminder Status` becomes `sent`) |
| Check-ins | Timer-based follow-ups | None (single delivery) |
| Rejection | User can reject suggestion | N/A (delivered once) |

Primary path: at intake, the agent calls `notion-cli.sh create-reminder` then uses `exec` and `openclaw cron add` for a one-shot job named `reminder-<page_id>` with `schedule.kind: "at"`, `at: remind_at`, `deleteAfterRun: true`, `sessionTarget: main`. The CLI path creates a working cron but does not increment OpenClaw's `successfulCronAdds` turn counter, so confirmation wording avoids first-person reminder/scheduling phrases that trigger `agent-runner-reminder-guard`. See `setup/cron/reminder-delivery.md` for the full contract. When the one-shot fires, its agent turn delivers via the `message` tool, atomically updates `state.json.recent_outbound`, calls `complete-reminder`, and the job self-deletes.

Safety net: isolated `reminder-check` cron writes handoff file and exits. Delivery through `reminder-delivery-sweep` (every 2 hours), the `heartbeat` cron (Check 1 in `docs/heartbeat-checks.md`, daily), or main-session startup check (AGENTS.md step 6, on every user interaction). Delivery paths first validate handoff is JSON with `reminders` array where each entry is object with string `page_id`, non-empty string `title`, and string `status`. New handoff writers emit only `sent`; legacy `missed` entries should still be delivered and normalized to `sent`. Any other shape or status = malformed handoff — file stays, delivering session resolves `OPS_ALERT_SIGNAL_NUMBER` from `.env` to concrete Signal recipient and sends ops alert via OpenClaw `message` tool (`action: send`, `channel: signal`, `target: "<resolved OPS_ALERT_SIGNAL_NUMBER>"`), nothing else delivered or completed. Valid reminders always use the same shame-safe copy: `Hey, time to [task]`. If delivery fails, handoff file left in place for retry.

After successful reminder delivery, the delivering session must also append/update `state.json.recent_outbound` with a short-lived entry describing what it just sent (`type: reminder`, `page_id`, `title`, `status: "sent"`, `sent_at`, `awaiting_response: true`, `expires_at`). That entry bridges the gap between sessions: if the user replies "I did it" or "tomorrow at 9" in a fresh session, the agent can resolve the reply against the reminder it just sent instead of asking what they mean. Clear the matched entry once the reply is resolved.

### Timezone Handling

AI converts user-specified times to full ISO 8601 timestamps at intake:
- Default timezone for both relative dates and unspecified clock times: the user's configured timezone in `USER.md` (fall back to US Central / America/Chicago only when `USER.md` is missing or has no timezone)
- "6pm PT" → `2025-01-04T18:00:00-08:00`
- "3pm" (no TZ) → `2025-01-04T15:00:00-06:00` (offset from USER.md; example shows Central)
- "tomorrow 9am ET" → `2025-01-05T09:00:00-05:00`

Relative references use the user's local calendar, not UTC session metadata. If message metadata says `2026-04-19T01:27:00Z` but `USER.md` timezone is `America/Chicago`, the user-local reference time is `2026-04-18T20:27:00-05:00`, so "tomorrow" resolves to `2026-04-19`, not `2026-04-20`. Use `scripts/user-time-context.sh` when the current timestamp needs conversion before reminder creation.
