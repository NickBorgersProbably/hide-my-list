"""Multi-turn conversation harness.

The unit of test here is a *conversation*, not a node call. Bug #641 — the
system being told a task was complete and unable to work out which task — lived
entirely in the seam between turns: `selection_node` writes `active_task` to the
LangGraph checkpoint, `reminder_worker` writes `recent_outbound` to Postgres, and
`complete_node` reads both several turns later. A test that calls one node with a
hand-built State dict cannot see that seam, which is why the whole class stayed
invisible.

Two deliberate choices:

**Entry is through `SignalListener`, not `graph.ainvoke`.** Three things under
test sit upstream of the graph. `thread_id` is derived from the peer E.164
(signal_listener.py) — enter at the graph and the test asserts its own assumption
about checkpoint partitioning, so a change to that derivation would leave every
chain green while every real conversation silently lost its history.
`_extract_peer_and_text` is production's only inbound parser. And the auth gate,
read-receipt scheduling, bounded receive queue, and typing-indicator background
tasks are all upstream of or wrapped around `ainvoke`, which is the only place a
background task could race the graph.

**The clock is never faked.** `complete_node` reads `datetime.now(UTC)` while
Postgres reads `now()`; faking one and not the other invents a skew that exists
in no deployment. Staleness is produced by writing backdated values instead —
`age_active_task` through `graph.aupdate_state`, `expire_recent_outbound`
through SQL.
