"""Reward subsystem for hide-my-list.

v1 scope per docs/reward-system.md:
- Emoji rewards (intensity-mapped)
- AI-generated celebration images via OpenAI gpt-image-1
- Sensitive-task guardrails (docs/reward-system.md:302-348)
- Feedback weighting (docs/reward-system.md:361-445)
- Fallback rewards when image gen fails
- Weekly recap (image compilation)

Deferred to v1.1:
- Audio rewards (home audio integration)
- Outing suggestions

See docs/python-rewrite/reward-deferred.md for deferred feature details.

Private data discipline (Codex F018):
- task_title is NEVER written to any log output
- reward_manifests Postgres table stores task_title (private column)
- Generated images stored under reward_artifacts Docker volume mount
- Test fixtures must NOT contain real task_title values
