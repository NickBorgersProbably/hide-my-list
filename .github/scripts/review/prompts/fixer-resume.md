You = ORIGINAL AUTHOR, resumed. PR #${PR_NUMBER} on ${REPO}. Reviewed SHA ${REVIEWED_SHA}, cycle ${REVIEW_CYCLE}.

You authored this PR earlier in the same conversation. The reviewer panel
has now examined what you produced. Their findings are below. Decide what
to do, then leave the working tree updated.

You stay in the conversation. Reviewers and judge are read-only.

## Current PR metadata

Decode current PR title/body before starting:
```bash
echo "$PR_TITLE_B64" | base64 -d
echo "$PR_BODY_B64" | base64 -d
```
Reflects current PR state, not what you opened.

## How this differs from a cold fixer

You have full context — every choice you made authoring the PR is in your
scrollback. A misreading by a reviewer (mistaking intent for a bug) is
something only you can spot. A real bug, you can revisit at the level you
made the original decision, not just patch the surface.

For each reviewer blocker, decide:
- **Real**: revisit your earlier choice. Apply the right fix at the right
  level. Add the blocker id to `addressed[]`.
- **Misread of intent**: do not change code. Sharpen the PR body so the
  reader sees the same intent the reviewer missed. Add to `addressed[]`
  only if the body edit closes the misread; otherwise add to `skipped[]`
  with a brief reason.
- **Out of scope**: leave it; add to `skipped[]` with reason "out of scope
  for this PR — file follow-up issue".

## Hard constraints

1. **Apply only what reviewers asked for.** Read every reviewer artifact
   under `${REVIEWER_ARTIFACTS_DIR}` (one subdir per role, each with
   `*-result.json`).
2. **No new scope.** No unrelated refactors, features, improvements.
   Unrelated bugs → leave for a future PR.
3. **Deterministic CI fixes NOT your job.** Lint/format/typecheck/test
   repair = upstream CI. Lint failure found → abort + report.
4. **Do NOT touch `.git/`.** No `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`,
   `git config`, `git rebase`. The host runner commits and pushes after
   you exit — `.git/` is bind-mounted under a different UID, and any
   git-write inside the container corrupts it (see PR #409).
5. **Read-only git fine.** `git diff`, `git log`, `git status`,
   `git show`, `git ls-files` all work. Container sets
   `safe.directory=/workspace` — use freely.
6. **One logical fix batch, unstaged.** Write files, edit text. No
   `git add`. Host step captures the working tree via `git add -A` and
   commits as one. Commit message is built from your `addressed[]` list.

7. **Don't include private content in fix output.** This repo is public. Fix summaries, `addressed[]` entries, `skipped[].reason` text, and any PR body edits must not name real people, real recipient data, real reminder content, real Notion page titles, or real personal events. State the technical issue; use placeholders (`<page_id>`, `<recipient>`, `"Test message"`, etc.).

## Merge conflict resolution

The pipeline attempted `git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/main` before
invoking you. Read `${MERGE_STATE}`:

- `none` or `clean`: nothing to do; proceed with reviewer-driven fixes only.
- `conflicts`: the merge left conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`,
  `>>>>>>>`) in the files listed in `${MERGE_CONFLICT_FILES}` (comma-
  separated). You authored this PR — you have the original intent in
  scrollback. Use that to pick the right resolution at each marker, on
  top of main's recent changes. Resolve EVERY marker BEFORE addressing
  reviewer blockers. When unsure, prefer main's structural changes and
  re-apply the PR's intent on top.

Same `.git/`-touch prohibition applies: edit files only, do not run
`git add` / `merge` / `commit` / `abort` / etc. The pipeline's host step
seals the merge after you exit. If any marker is still present, the
pipeline aborts the merge and labels the PR `needs-human-review` —
resolve them all.

## Procedure

1. List reviewer artifacts:
   ```bash
   find "${REVIEWER_ARTIFACTS_DIR}" -name '*-result.json'
   ```
2. No reviewer files or unparseable → no edits. Write a no-op fix result
   to `$OUTPUT_PATH` and stop.
3. Read every blocker. Categorize each as real / misread / out-of-scope.
4. Apply real-blocker fixes at the level you originally decided. If a
   group of files needs the same change, apply uniformly — no per-file
   improvisation.
5. For misreads: decode the current PR body to a temp file, edit that
   file to clarify intent, then run
   `gh pr edit ${PR_NUMBER} --body-file "$BODY_FILE"` so markdown,
   backticks, and `$VAR` references are passed verbatim without shell
   reinterpretation. Preserve both of the following exactly as they
   appear in the file:
   - An issue-closing line of the form `Resolves #N`, `Fixes #N`, or
     `Closes #N` on its own line — `review-fixer.yml` parses this to
     recover the issue number for session-dir lookup; dropping it
     disables author-resume on the next cycle and falls back to fresh
     Claude.
   - The `Author-Session: <agent>/<run-id>` trailer — the next cycle
     reads it to resume you again.
6. Leave file changes unstaged. Host step commits.
7. Write fix-result JSON to `$OUTPUT_PATH`.

## Output contract

Write to `$OUTPUT_PATH`, conforming to
`.github/scripts/review/schema/fix-result-v1.json`:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1",
  "input_sha": "${REVIEWED_SHA}",
  "new_sha": "${REVIEWED_SHA}",
  "addressed": ["security/sec-001", "docs/doc-001"],
  "skipped": [
    { "id": "design/d-002", "reason": "out of scope; opened follow-up #NNN" }
  ]
}
```

Always set `new_sha` to `${REVIEWED_SHA}`. Host commit step rewrites it
with the real post-commit SHA before judge reads.

`addressed[]` and `skipped[].id` MUST be namespaced as `<role>/<id>`.
Judge fails closed on bare ids — prevents two reviewers' colliding ids
from cross-clearing.

`input_sha` MUST equal `${REVIEWED_SHA}`. Judge fails closed on mismatch.
