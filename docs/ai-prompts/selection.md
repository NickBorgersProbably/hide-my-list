### Task Selection Prompt

```
Select the best task for the user based on their current context.

USER CONTEXT:
- Available time: {available_minutes} minutes
- Current mood: {mood} (maps to: {preferred_work_type})
- Time of day: {time_of_day}

PENDING TASKS:
{tasks_json}

SCORING RULES:
1. Time Fit (30% weight):
   - Task fits with buffer: 1.0
   - Tight fit (within 10%): 0.5
   - Doesn't fit: 0.0 (EXCLUDE)

2. Mood Match (40% weight):
   - Perfect match: 1.0
   - Related type: 0.5
   - Opposite type: 0.0

3. Urgency (20% weight):
   - Score = urgency / 100

4. History (10% weight):
   - No rejections: 0.1
   - 1-2 rejections: 0.05
   - 3+ rejections: 0.0

MOOD MAPPING:
- "focused/sharp" → prefer focus work
- "creative/inspired" → prefer creative work
- "social/energetic" → prefer social work
- "tired/low energy" → prefer independent work

OUTPUT (JSON):
{
  "selected_task_id": "...",
  "score": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "brief explanation",
  "user_message": "conversational suggestion"
}

If no tasks fit, explain why and suggest alternatives.
```

### Mood to Work Type Affinity

    subgraph Mood["User Mood"]
        Focused["Focused / Sharp"]
        Creative["Creative / Inspired"]
        Social["Social / Energetic"]
        Tired["Tired / Low Energy"]
    end

    subgraph Affinity["Work Type Affinity"]
        FocusHigh["focus: 1.0<br/>creative: 0.6<br/>social: 0.3<br/>independent: 0.4"]
        CreativeHigh["creative: 1.0<br/>focus: 0.5<br/>social: 0.4<br/>independent: 0.3"]
        SocialHigh["social: 1.0<br/>creative: 0.5<br/>independent: 0.6<br/>focus: 0.4"]
        TiredHigh["independent: 1.0<br/>social: 0.4<br/>creative: 0.3<br/>focus: 0.2"]
    end

    Focused --> FocusHigh
    Creative --> CreativeHigh
    Social --> SocialHigh
    Tired --> TiredHigh
```

### Selection Message Templates

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Templates["Message Confidence"]
        High["Score > 0.8<br/>'Perfect timing - how about [task]?<br/>It matches your [time] and [mood].'"]
        Medium["Score 0.5-0.8<br/>'I'd suggest [task].<br/>It's [urgency level] and fits your time.'"]
        Low["Score < 0.5<br/>'Best I can find is [task].<br/>Not perfect, but might work?'"]
        None["No match<br/>'Nothing quite fits right now.<br/>Want to add something quick?'"]
    end
```
