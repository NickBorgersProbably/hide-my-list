"""COMPLETE node: task completion + reward integration.

Marks the finished task as completed in Notion, triggers the reward subsystem,
and drafts a celebration message into pending_outbound.

Three sources can identify which task the user means, in order of authority:
a task named in the message itself, the unresolved reminder the assistant last
sent, and the task handed to the user by selection. The message wins because it
is the only source the user can steer — the other two are inferences from
context that goes stale, and when they both do, nothing else can resolve
"finished the dishes" to a page.

When none of the three resolves, the node asks — and records the question in
`pending_clarification` so the reply that answers it comes back here instead of
re-entering cold and re-asking. A failure in any one source narrows the answer,
never the question: the lookups are independent, so a dead Postgres or an empty
shortlist must not stop the others from running.

Reward integration implemented in PR-B5.
