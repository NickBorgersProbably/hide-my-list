# Task Lifecycle

## Overview

A task in hide-my-list goes through several states from creation to completion. This document details each phase of that journey.

## Complete Task Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Intake: User describes task

    Intake --> Labeling: Task captured
    Labeling --> Complexity: Labels assigned
    Complexity --> Pending: Simple task
    Complexity --> Breakdown: Complex task

    Breakdown --> Pending: Sub-tasks created (hidden)

    Pending --> Selected: User requests task
    Pending --> Pending: Time passes (urgency static)

    Selected --> InProgress: User accepts
    Selected --> Rejected: User rejects

    Rejected --> Pending: Rejection recorded
    Rejected --> Selected: Alternative suggested

    InProgress --> CheckIn: Timer expires (1.25x estimate)
    InProgress --> Completed: User finishes
    InProgress --> Pending: User abandons
    InProgress --> CannotFinish: Task too large

    CannotFinish --> Breakdown: Break into smaller pieces

    CheckIn --> Completed: User confirms done
    CheckIn --> InProgress: User still working
    CheckIn --> Pending: User abandons

    Completed --> [*]
```

## Task States

| State | Description | Notion Status |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Intake | Task being captured, AI inferring labels (may ask up to 3 clarifying questions if too vague) | N/A (not yet saved) |
| Labeling | AI assigning work type, urgency, time estimate | N/A (not yet saved) |
| Complexity | AI evaluating if task needs breakdown | N/A (not yet saved) |
| Breakdown | AI creating sub-tasks (hidden from user) | N/A (parent) / `pending` (sub-tasks) |
| Pending | Task saved, waiting to be selected | `pending` |
| Selected | Task suggested to user, awaiting response | `pending` |
| In Progress | User actively working on task | `in_progress` |
| Check-In | System following up on task progress | `in_progress` |
| Rejected | User declined, giving feedback | `pending` |
| Cannot Finish | User indicates task is too large | `in_progress` (triggers breakdown) |
| Completed | Task finished | `completed` |

## Phase 1: Task Intake

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User sends message]) --> Parse[AI parses message]
    Parse --> IsTask{Is this a task?}

    IsTask -->|No| Chat[Handle as conversation]
    IsTask -->|Yes| Extract[Extract task details]

    Extract --> Infer[Infer ALL labels aggressively]
    Infer --> Clear{Task clear enough?}
    Clear -->|Yes| Save[Save with inferred defaults]
    Clear -->|No, too vague| AskCount{Questions asked < 3?}

    Save --> Confirm([Confirm with inferred labels])
    Confirm --> Correction{User corrects?}
    Correction -->|Yes| Update[Update task]
    Correction -->|No / Moves on| Done([Done])
```

## Phase 2: Label Assignment

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["Task Description"]
        Desc["Review Sarah's proposal<br/>by Friday"]
    end

    subgraph Analysis["AI Analysis"]
        Keywords[Keyword extraction]

        Deadline[Deadline detection]
    end

    subgraph Labels["Assigned Labels"]
        Type[WorkType: focus]
        Urgency[Urgency: 65/100]
        Time[TimeEstimate: 30 min]
        Energy[EnergyRequired: medium]
    end

    Input --> Keywords
    Input --> Context
    Input --> Deadline

    Keywords --> Type
    Context --> Type
    Context --> Time
    Context --> Energy
    Deadline --> Urgency
```

### Label Inference Rules

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph WorkType["Work Type Inference"]
        W1[/"write, analyze, code, research"/] --> Focus[focus]
        W2[/"brainstorm, ideate, design, explore"/] --> Creative[creative]
        W3[/"call, meet, email, discuss"/] --> Social[social]
        W4[/"file, organize, pay, book"/] --> Independent[independent]
    end

    subgraph UrgencyRules["Urgency Inference"]
        U1[/"today, ASAP, urgent"/] --> High[70-100]
        U2[/"this week, by Friday"/] --> Medium[40-70]
        U3[/"whenever, no rush"/] --> Low[0-40]
    end

    subgraph TimeRules["Time Estimation"]
        T1[/"quick, brief, short"/] --> Quick[15-30 min]
        T2[/"meeting, review"/] --> Med[30-60 min]
        T3[/"project, deep work"/] --> Long[90+ min]
    end
```

## Phase 2.5: Sub-task Generation (All Tasks)

After labeling, the AI **always** generates a series of actionable sub-tasks for every task. This is a core principle: **users interpret vague goals as infinite, and thus avoid them.** By providing clear, specific sub-tasks upfront, we give users a defined path forward.

**Key Principle:** Every task, no matter how simple it appears, gets explicit sub-tasks that define exactly what "done" looks like.

**Key Enhancement:** Sub-tasks are personalized based on user preferences to create an environment for success. The first 1-2 steps focus on preparation and comfort.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Labeled([Task Labeled]) --> FetchPrefs[Fetch user preferences]
    FetchPrefs --> BuildContext[Build preference context]
    BuildContext --> Generate[Generate personalized sub-tasks]

    Generate --> Evaluate{Task size?}

    Evaluate -->|Small task<br/>15-30 min| InlineSteps[Store sub-tasks inline<br/>Present as numbered steps]
    Evaluate -->|Medium/Large task<br/>> 30 min| CreateHidden[Create sub-tasks in Notion<br/>Hidden from user]

    InlineSteps --> Ready([Task ready for selection])
    CreateHidden --> LinkParent[Link to parent task]
    LinkParent --> SaveParent[Save parent as container]
    SaveParent --> Ready
```

### Why All Tasks Get Sub-tasks

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Problem["The Problem"]
        Vague["'Call mom'<br/>Feels unbounded"]
        Infinite["User imagines<br/>infinite scope"]
        Avoidance["Task avoidance"]
    end

    subgraph Solution["The Solution"]
        Specific["'Call mom'<br/>1. Make a cup of tea<br/>2. Settle into cozy chair<br/>3. Make the call<br/>4. Note any follow-ups"]
        Bounded["Clear, finite steps"]
        Comfort["Personalized comfort"]
        Action["User takes action"]
    end

    Problem --> Solution
```

### Personalized Prep Steps

Before generating core task steps, the system fetches user preferences and injects them into the breakdown prompt. This enables personalized "environment for success" steps.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Preferences["User Preferences Lookup"]
        General["General: tea, cozy chair"]
        WorkType["Social: quiet spot, review context"]
        Pattern["Phone calls: review last chat"]
        Context["Afternoon, medium energy"]
    end

    subgraph Generation["Personalized Generation"]
        Prep["Prep steps: beverage + environment"]
        Core["Core steps: actual task actions"]
        FollowUp["Follow-up: capture outcomes"]
    end

    subgraph Output["Final Breakdown"]
        Step1["1. Make a cup of tea"]
        Step2["2. Settle into the cozy chair"]
        Step3["3. Make the call"]
        Step4["4. Note any follow-ups"]
    end

    Preferences --> Generation
    Generation --> Output
```

See [user-preferences.md](./user-preferences.md) for full preference system documentation.

### Sub-task Generation Rules

| Task Type | Sub-task Approach | Example (with preferences: tea, cozy chair) |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Quick (15 min) | 2-4 inline steps | "Call mom" → 1. Make tea, 2. Settle into cozy chair, 3. Make call, 4. Note follow-ups |
| Standard (30-60 min) | 3-6 inline steps | "Review proposal" → 1. Make coffee, 2. Find quiet spot, 3. Read intro, 4. Check numbers, 5. Note concerns, 6. Draft feedback |
| Large (60+ min) | Hidden sub-tasks | "Complete report" → 4+ separate tasks in Notion (each with prep steps) |

### Complexity Signals (For Hidden vs. Inline)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Triggers["Hidden Sub-task Triggers"]
        Vague["Vague scope<br/>'complete', 'finish', 'work on'"]
        Long["Long duration<br/>> 60 minutes estimated"]
        Multi["Multiple phases<br/>research + draft + review"]
        Deliverables["Multiple outputs<br/>'prepare and send'"]
    end

    subgraph Decision["Storage Decision"]
        Hidden[Store as separate Notion tasks]
        Inline[Store as inline steps in task description]
    end

    Vague --> Hidden
    Long --> Hidden
    Multi --> Hidden
    Deliverables --> Hidden
```

### Sub-task Structure

When a task is broken down, the system creates:
- **Parent task**: The original task description (status: `has_subtasks`)
- **Sub-tasks**: Actionable pieces (status: `pending`, linked to parent)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Parent["Parent Task (Hidden Structure)"]
        P["Complete Q4 report<br/>Status: has_subtasks"]
    end

    subgraph SubTasks["Sub-tasks (Hidden from User)"]
        S1["1. Draft outline<br/>30 min | pending"]
        S2["2. Write introduction<br/>45 min | pending"]
        S3["3. Write analysis<br/>60 min | pending"]
        S4["4. Edit and finalize<br/>30 min | pending"]
    end

    P --> S1
    P --> S2
    P --> S3
    P --> S4
```

**User Experience:** When a task is suggested, the user sees the actionable first step along with a brief summary of what completing the full task involves:

- For inline steps: "How about calling mom? Here's the plan: 1) Find a quiet spot, 2) Make the call, 3) Note any follow-ups. Should take about 15 minutes."
- For hidden sub-tasks: "How about drafting the outline for the Q4 report? This is the first of 4 steps to complete the full report. Should take about 30 minutes."

### On-Demand Breakdown Assistance

The agent must always stand ready to help users further break down tasks. When a user starts a task or expresses hesitation, the agent proactively offers specific suggestions for how to approach the work.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    UserStarts([User accepts task]) --> Offer[Agent offers breakdown assistance]

    Offer --> UserReady{"User response?"}
    UserReady -->|"Just tell me what to do"| Prescriptive[Provide exact first action]
    UserReady -->|"What are my steps?"| ShowSteps[Show all sub-tasks]
    UserReady -->|"I got it"| Proceed[Let user proceed]
    UserReady -->|Hesitation detected| Probe[Ask what feels unclear]

    Probe --> Clarify[Provide more specific breakdown]
    Prescriptive --> Work([User works])
    ShowSteps --> Work
    Proceed --> Work
    Clarify --> Work
```

**Key Behaviors:**
- Agent never assumes user knows what to do next
- Agent always has specific, concrete next actions ready
- If user seems stuck, agent proactively offers smaller sub-tasks
- User should never have to figure out "how" on their own

### Task Reframing

| User Says | What User Sees (personalized) | Hidden Reality |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| "Complete the project" | "Make coffee, then draft project outline - 35 min" | 4 sub-tasks created (each with personalized prep) |
| "Finish the report" | "Find your quiet spot, then write report introduction - 50 min" | 4 sub-tasks created |
| "Plan the event" | "Grab a tea and list event requirements - 25 min" | 5 sub-tasks created |
| "Call mom" | "Make tea, settle into cozy chair, make call - 15 min" | Inline steps with prep |

## Phase 3: Task Selection

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request([User: "I have 30 min, feeling tired"]) --> Parse[Parse time + mood]
    Parse --> Fetch[Fetch pending tasks from Notion]
    Fetch --> Score[Score each task]

    subgraph Scoring["Scoring Algorithm"]
        TimeFit[Time Fit × 0.3]
        MoodMatch[Mood Match × 0.4]
        UrgencyScore[Urgency × 0.2]
        History[History Bonus × 0.1]

        TimeFit --> Total[Total Score]
        MoodMatch --> Total
        UrgencyScore --> Total
        History --> Total
    end

    Score --> Scoring
    Total --> Select[Select highest score]
    Select --> Present([Present to user])
```

### Scoring Details

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph TimeFit["Time Fit Score"]
        Available[Available: 30 min]
        Estimate[Task: 25 min]
        Available --> Calc1{Fits?}
        Estimate --> Calc1
        Calc1 -->|Yes, buffer OK| T1["1.0"]
        Calc1 -->|Tight| T2["0.5"]
        Calc1 -->|Too long| T3["0.0"]
    end

    subgraph MoodMatch["Mood Match Score"]
        UserMood[User: tired]
        TaskType[Task: independent]
        UserMood --> Calc2{Match?}
        TaskType --> Calc2
        Calc2 -->|Perfect| M1["1.0"]
        Calc2 -->|Neutral| M2["0.5"]
        Calc2 -->|Mismatch| M3["0.0"]
    end
```

### Mood to Work Type Matching

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Mood to Work Type Affinity
    x-axis Low Match --> High Match
    y-axis Low Energy --> High Energy
    quadrant-1 Creative Tasks
    quadrant-2 Focus Tasks
    quadrant-3 Independent Tasks
    quadrant-4 Social Tasks
    "Tired User": [0.2, 0.2]
    "Focused User": [0.8, 0.7]
    "Creative User": [0.7, 0.8]
    "Social User": [0.8, 0.6]
```

## Phase 4: Task Execution

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Task Presented" as Presented
    state "Decision Point" as Decision
    state "Working" as Working
    state "Completion Check" as Check

    [*] --> Presented
    Presented --> Decision

    Decision --> Working: Accept
    Decision --> Rejected: Reject

    Working --> Check: User signals done
    Working --> Interrupted: User needs to switch

    Check --> Completed: Confirmed done
    Check --> Working: Need more time

    Interrupted --> Pending: Task returned to queue
    Rejected --> Alternative: Get new suggestion
    Alternative --> Presented

    Completed --> [*]
```

## Phase 5: Check-In Follow-Up

When a user accepts a task, the system provides a brief **initiation reward** (acknowledging that starting is the hardest part), sets `started_at`, and sets a timer for 1.25x the estimated time. If the user hasn't marked the task complete, the system proactively checks in.

> **Task Initiation Rewards (Issue #7):** Starting is harder than finishing for
> ADHD brains. The moment of acceptance triggers a brief acknowledgment:
> "You're in. That's the hardest part." This is lighter than completion
> celebrations — encouragement, not a party.

```mermaid

    InitReward --> SetStarted[Set started_at timestamp]
    SetStarted --> SetTimer[Set timer: estimate × 1.25]
    SetTimer --> Wait[Timer running...]

    Wait --> TimerFires{Timer expires}
    Wait --> UserDone[User says "Done!"]

    UserDone --> ClearTimer[Clear timer]

    CheckStatus -->|No| Skip[Already completed/abandoned]
    CheckStatus -->|Yes| AskUser["How's [task] going?"]

    AskUser --> Response{User response}

    Response --> Done["Done!"]
    Response --> Working["Still working"]
    Response --> Distracted["Got distracted"]
    Response --> NeedMore["Need more time"]
    Response --> Abandon["Want to stop"]

    Done --> Complete
    Working --> ResetTimer1[Reset timer: 0.5x original]
    Distracted --> Nudge["Want to jump back in?"]
    NeedMore --> AskHow["How much longer?"]
    Abandon --> ReturnQueue[Return to pending]

    ResetTimer1 --> Wait2[Timer running...]
    Nudge --> Response2{User choice}
    AskHow --> NewTime[User gives time]

    Response2 -->|Yes| ResetTimer2[Reset timer]
    Response2 -->|No| ReturnQueue

    NewTime --> ResetTimer3[Set new timer]
    ResetTimer2 --> Wait2
    ResetTimer3 --> Wait2

    Wait2 --> CheckIn2{2nd check-in}
    CheckIn2 --> FinalResponse{Response?}

    FinalResponse -->|Done| Complete
    FinalResponse -->|Still working| CheckIn3[3rd check-in]
    FinalResponse -->|Abandon| ReturnQueue

    CheckIn3 --> Gentle["Maybe take a break?<br/>I'll be here when you're ready."]
```

### Check-In Timing Examples

| Time Estimate | First Check-In | Subsequent Check-Ins |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 15 min | 18.75 min | +7.5 min, +3.75 min |
| 30 min | 37.5 min | +15 min, +7.5 min |
| 60 min | 75 min | +30 min, +15 min |
| 120 min | 150 min | +60 min, +30 min |

### Check-In Response Handling

| Response | Action | Timer |
|----------|--------|-------|
| "Done!" | Mark completed | Clear |
| "Still working" | Encourage | Reset to 0.5x |
| "Got distracted" | Gentle nudge | Reset to 0.5x if continuing |
| "Need X more minutes" | Acknowledge | Set to X × 1.25 |
| "Want to stop" | Return to queue | Clear |

### Maximum Check-Ins

The system limits check-ins to 3 per task session to avoid nagging:

1. **1st check-in**: Friendly inquiry
2. **2nd check-in**: Brief follow-up
3. **3rd check-in**: Suggest taking a break, stop checking in

If the user returns later and re-accepts the same task, the check-in count resets.

## Phase 5.1: Resume Detection

When a user returns to a task after stepping away, the system detects the resume and increments `resume_count`. Re-engaging with a task after a break requires real effort (especially for ADHD brains), and the system acknowledges this with a "back at it" reward.

### What Constitutes a Resume

A resume is detected when a task has status `in_progress` and **any one** of the following detection signals fires:

1. **Session boundary** — a new conversation session starts while a task is `in_progress` (triggers regardless of time since last message)
2. **Inactivity gap** — no user messages for >= 15 minutes with an `in_progress` task, then the user re-engages with the active task
3. **Explicit signal** — user says phrases like "I'm back", "picking up where I left off", "resuming" (triggers regardless of time since last message)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    HasActive{Task currently<br/>in_progress?}

    HasActive -->|No| Normal[Handle normally]
    HasActive -->|Yes| NewSession{New conversation<br/>session?}

    NewSession -->|Yes| Resume[Trigger resume]
    NewSession -->|No| ExplicitSignal{User says<br/>'I'm back' etc.?}

    ExplicitSignal -->|Yes| Resume
    ExplicitSignal -->|No| CheckGap{Last user message<br/>> 15 min ago?}

    CheckGap -->|No| Continue[Continue session<br/>No resume triggered]
    CheckGap -->|Yes| Resume

    Resume --> Increment[Increment resume_count]
    Increment --> Reward["'Welcome back! Picking up<br/>where you left off is a superpower.'"]
    Reward --> ResetCheckins[Reset check-in count]
    ResetCheckins --> SetTimer[Set new check-in timer]
```

### Detection Signals (Priority Order)

The system uses a layered approach to detect resumes:

| Priority | Signal | Detection Method | Time gap required? | Example |
|----------|--------|------------------|--------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Session boundary** | A new conversation session starts while a task is `in_progress` | No | User opens a new chat window |
| 2 | **Explicit signal** | User says phrases like "I'm back", "picking up where I left off", "resuming" | No | User announces return |
| 3 | **Inactivity gap** | No user messages for >= 15 minutes with an `in_progress` task | Yes (>= 15 min) | User goes to lunch, comes back |

Any one of these signals is sufficient to trigger a resume. Session boundaries and explicit signals always trigger a resume regardless of the time gap; the 15-minute threshold applies only to passive inactivity detection.

### Time Threshold Rationale

The 15-minute threshold balances two concerns:

- **Too short** (< 10 min): Normal pauses (bathroom, getting water) would trigger false resumes
- **Too long** (> 30 min): Genuine re-engagement after distraction would go unrecognized

15 minutes is chosen because it exceeds typical micro-breaks but catches the common ADHD pattern of getting pulled away by a distraction and returning.

### Resume vs. Abandon

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Gap{Inactivity gap<br/>with in_progress task} --> Short{< 15 min?}
    Short -->|Yes| NoAction[No action — normal pause]
    Short -->|No| Medium{< 4 hours?}
    Medium -->|Yes| ResumeDetected[Resume detected<br/>Increment resume_count]
    Medium -->|No| Long{< 24 hours?}
    Long -->|Yes| GentleResume["Resume + gentle check-in<br/>'Still working on X?'"]
    Long -->|No| AbandonCheck["Offer to return task to queue<br/>'Want to keep going or set this aside?'"]
```

| Gap Duration | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| < 15 min | No action (normal pause) |
| 15 min – 4 hours | Resume detected, increment `resume_count`, brief encouragement |
| 4 – 24 hours | Resume detected, increment `resume_count`, confirm user still wants to work on task |
| > 24 hours | Ask if user wants to continue or return task to `pending` |

### Resume Rewards

Returning to a task is psychologically harder than starting one fresh. The system acknowledges this:

| Resume Count | Reward |
|-------------|--------|
| 1st resume | "Welcome back! Picking up where you left off is a superpower." |
| 2nd resume | "Back again — that's persistence." |
| 3rd+ resume | "You keep coming back to this. That takes real grit." |

### On Resume: State Restoration

When a resume is detected, the system:

1. Increments `resume_count`
2. Appends a timestamped entry to `progress_notes`: `[timestamp] Resumed (gap: Xm)`
3. Resets the check-in count to 0 (fresh check-in cycle)
4. Sets a new check-in timer based on remaining estimated time
5. Briefly reminds the user where they left off (using `progress_notes` and `steps_completed`)

## Phase 6: Rejection Handling

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Reject([User rejects task]) --> Why{Ask why}

    Why --> Timing["Takes too long"]
    Why --> Mood["Not in the mood"]
    Why --> Blocked["Waiting on something"]
    Why --> Done["Already done"]
    Why --> Other["Just not feeling it"]

    Timing --> UpdateTime[Adjust time estimate]
    Mood --> RecordMood[Record mood mismatch]
    Blocked --> MarkBlocked[Mark as blocked]
    Done --> Complete[Mark completed]
    Other --> IncrementReject[Increment rejection count]

    UpdateTime --> FindAlt[Find alternative]
    RecordMood --> FindAlt
    IncrementReject --> FindAlt

    MarkBlocked --> Retry([Return to queue])
    Complete --> Celebrate([Celebrate completion])
    FindAlt --> Present([Present new task])
```

### Rejection Learning

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Pattern["Pattern Detection"]
        R1[3+ rejections<br/>same work type] --> Learn1[Lower work type<br/>affinity for time of day]
        R2[Rejected when<br/>user said 'tired'] --> Learn2[Increase energy<br/>requirement]
        R3[Time estimate<br/>mismatch] --> Learn3[Adjust estimate<br/>multiplier]
    end

    subgraph Action["Action Taken"]
        Learn1 --> A1[Avoid suggesting<br/>focus work at night]
        Learn2 --> A2[Only suggest<br/>low-energy tasks]
        Learn3 --> A3[Multiply estimates<br/>by 1.2x]
    end
```

## Phase 5.5: Cannot Finish (Re-breakdown)

When a user indicates they cannot finish a task, the system gathers progress information and creates new sub-tasks for the remaining work.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Working([User working on task]) --> CannotFinish["User: 'This is too big'"]
    CannotFinish --> AskProgress[AI asks what was accomplished]
    AskProgress --> UserResponds[User describes progress]
    UserResponds --> Analyze[Analyze remaining work]
    Analyze --> CreateNew[Create sub-tasks for remainder]
    CreateNew --> UpdateParent[Update parent task progress]
    UpdateParent --> OfferNext[Offer next manageable piece]
    OfferNext --> Continue([Continue with smaller task])
```

### Progress Gathering

The AI must always ask what the user accomplished before breaking down remaining work:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant N as Notion

    U->>AI: "I can't finish this"
    AI->>U: "No worries - what did you get done?"
    U->>AI: "I outlined it and wrote the intro"

    Note over AI: Progress: outline + intro done<br/>Remaining: body + conclusion + edit

    AI->>N: Update task with progress notes
    AI->>N: Create sub-tasks for remainder (hidden)

    AI->>U: "Nice progress! Ready to tackle the body section? About 45 min."
```

### Re-breakdown Rules

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| First CANNOT_FINISH | Ask progress → Break into 3-5 sub-tasks |
| Second CANNOT_FINISH | Break current sub-task into 2-3 smaller pieces |
| Third+ CANNOT_FINISH | Ask what specific part is blocking → Create atomic tasks |

### Learning from Cannot Finish

Each CANNOT_FINISH signal teaches the system:
- Original time estimates may be too aggressive
- Task scope was underestimated
- Future similar tasks should be pre-broken

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Signal["CANNOT_FINISH Signal"]
        CF[Task too large]
    end

    subgraph Learning["System Learning"]
        L1[Increase time estimates<br/>for similar tasks]
        L2[Lower complexity threshold<br/>for auto-breakdown]
        L3[Remember task patterns<br/>that need breakdown]
    end

    CF --> L1
    CF --> L2
    CF --> L3
```

### Reward Intensity Scaling

The reward system scales celebrations based on achievement significance:

| Trigger | Intensity | Rewards Activated |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Quick task (< 15 min) | Low | Emoji only |
| Standard task | Medium | Emoji + maybe GIF |
| Focus/difficult task | High | Emoji + GIF + Music + Text SO |
| Parent task complete | Epic | All rewards + AI video + Outing suggestion |
| All tasks cleared | Epic | Maximum celebration |
