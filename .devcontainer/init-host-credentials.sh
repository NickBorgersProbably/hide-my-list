# Ensure every devcontainer.json bind-mount source exists before Docker
# tries to resolve it. Missing bind-mount sources are dangerous: Docker
# silently materializes them as root-owned directories on the host (on
# Linux) or errors out at container start (on macOS / Docker Desktop).
# Creating user-owned placeholders here is a cheap no-op when the files
# already exist, and guarantees the devcontainer can spin up on any
# contributor's machine. post-create.sh uses `-s` (non-empty) guards
# before wiring anything in, so empty placeholders are installed but
# never activated.
