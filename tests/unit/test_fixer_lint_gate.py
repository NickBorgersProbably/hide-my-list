"""Structural lint: review-fixer.yml pre-commit lint gate.

Asserts that review-fixer.yml contains a full-tree ruff lint step that runs
before the commit step, and that the host-side commit step activates the
pre-commit hook via core.hooksPath.

Bug class prevention: closes the gap where the fixer pipeline's host-side
git commit skipped the pre-commit hook entirely (no GIT_CONFIG_COUNT set)
and where ruff only checked staged files (hook) rather than the full tree
being pushed. See PR #594 — a pre-existing UP037 violation introduced by
PR #589 propagated through the fixer undetected.
