# Reward System

## Overview

The reward system is a core component of hide-my-list designed to provide dopamine-inducing positive reinforcement when users complete tasks or make progress. By leveraging multiple reward channels—both system-generated and interpersonal—we create a powerful motivation loop that keeps users engaged and productive.

## Reward Philosophy

```mermaid

  root((Dopamine<br/>Delivery))
    System Generated
      Visual Celebration
        Emoji explosions
        Animated GIFs
        AI-generated videos
      Audio Celebration
        Favorite songs
        Victory sounds
        Home audio integration
    Interpersonal
      Significant Other
        Completion texts
        Progress updates
        Shared victories
      Self-Reward
        Outing suggestions
        Interest-aligned treats
        Break recommendations
```

The reward system operates on the principle that **completing tasks should feel genuinely rewarding**. We achieve this through:

1. **Immediate gratification** - Instant visual/audio feedback
2. **Social reinforcement** - Loved ones acknowledge achievements
3. **Anticipatory pleasure** - Suggestions for enjoyable activities

### RSD-Safe Reward Principles

> **Shame Prevention:** The reward system must never create an implicit comparison
> between "good" sessions (many completions) and "bad" sessions (few or none).
> Rewards celebrate what happened, never highlight what didn't.

- **Celebrate effort, not just results** — "You showed up and tried today. That counts."
- **Never reference streak breaks negatively** — if a streak ends, don't mention it. Just start fresh.
- **Partial progress is real progress** — completing sub-tasks deserves acknowledgment
- **Safe exits get warmth, not silence** — "See you next time" is better than no response
- **No guilt-inducing comparisons** — never "You did 3 tasks yesterday but only 1 today"
