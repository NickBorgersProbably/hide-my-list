"""Scenario 12 — a paraphrase, and a question the agent remembers asking.

The fourth instance of the resolution bug class (#641, #655, then this). The
pattern each time: a source is added, and the seam around it goes untested. Here
the source added by #655 was real but unreachable — a token-overlap shortlist
stood in front of it and returned an empty candidate set for any message that
described a task instead of quoting it, so the model that was supposed to
adjudicate never saw the list.

Production, three turns, 35 seconds:

    "which task did you mean?" → user answers → same question → user answers
    → same question

Byte-identical each time, because the reply cleared `conversation_state` and
`active_task` and recorded nothing about having asked.

These scenarios are cross-turn on purpose. A single-turn test can prove the
model got the list; only a chain can prove the second turn behaves differently
from the first, which is the half the user actually experienced.

    "old fridge" against "Deal with the spare refrigerator" shares no token the
