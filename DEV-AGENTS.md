# DEV-AGENTS.md — hide-my-list

Dev agent context for Claude Code, Codex, human contributors.

## Architecture

- **Runtime**: Python + LangGraph app in Docker Compose
- **Storage**: Postgres (LangGraph checkpointer + reminder outbox + scheduler + private metadata) + Notion DB (tasks)
- **Messaging**: Signal via signal-cli bridge (infra-provided)
- **Scripts**: `scripts/` — Python migration helpers + ops CLIs
- **Docs**: `docs/` — spec contracts + contributor/CI guidance
- **Design**: `design/` — ADHD-informed design priorities

### Infrastructure & CI Files

Support dev pipeline. Edit directly via PRs — any contributor or agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.).

- `.devcontainer/` — Devcontainer definition. `post-create.sh` provisions `.venv` via `uv` (Python 3.12, `-e ".[dev]"`) so a fresh clone can run `pytest tests/unit/` with no manual setup; `devcontainer.json` puts `.venv/bin` on `remoteEnv.PATH` so the `.githooks/pre-commit` gate resolves `pytest` / `ruff` without shell activation. CI's `Devcontainer Build Check` builds the image only — it does not run `postCreateCommand`, so `tests/unit/test_devcontainer_python_env.py` guards the provisioning wiring.
- `.github/workflows/` — GitHub Actions workflow definitions
- `.github/actions/` — Composite actions used by workflows
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — Default PR body template, including the `/review` fallback hint for missing initial review checks
- `.github/actions/review-claude-run/` — Direct-`docker run` composite invoking Claude Code against the LiteLLM Anthropic endpoint; v2 pipeline single-writer fixer (fresh-Claude fallback path for human-authored PRs)
- `.github/actions/review-codex-resume/` — Composite that resumes the original `resolve-issue` Codex author session as the v2 fixer; bind-mounts the persisted session into `/home/ci/.codex` and runs `codex exec resume --last`
- `.github/actions/review-claude-resume/` — Composite that resumes the original `resolve-issue` Claude Code author session as the v2 fixer; bind-mounts the persisted session into `/home/ci/.claude` and runs `claude --continue`
- `.github/scripts/review/prompts/fixer-claude-smoke.md` — Prompt for the Claude fixer auth/IO smoke test
- `.github/scripts/review/prompts/fixer-resume.md` — Prompt loaded by both resume actions; the resumed author already has full authoring context, so the prompt only hands over reviewer artifacts and reasserts the `.git/`-don't-touch + output-contract constraints
- `.github/workflows/review-fixer-claude-smoke.yml` — Pre-merge smoke test exercising the Claude fixer container path on PRs touching that path
- `.github/workflows/review-fixer-resume-smoke.yml` — Pre-merge smoke test exercising the resume-fixer dispatch logic (`scripts/test-ci-session-store.sh`); full cross-container resume validated by the first multi-cycle review on a `resolve-issue` PR
- `.github/ci/prompts/codex-resolve-issue.md` — Codex author prompt invoked by the `codex` agent path in `resolve-issue`; carries the `Author-Session: codex/${RUN_ID}` PR-body trailer contract
- `.github/ci/prompts/claude-resolve-issue.md` — Claude Code author prompt invoked by the `claude` agent path in `resolve-issue`; carries the `Author-Session: claude/${RUN_ID}` PR-body trailer contract
- `.github/scripts/review/render-finalize-comment.sh` — Renders and posts the operator-facing "Agent Review Summary" merge-decision comment for `review-finalize.yml`; branches on verdict category (`go`, `reviewer_blockers`, `pipeline_error`, `cycle_capped`, `inherited`)
- `.github/ci/caveman-rules.md` — Canonical CI-only caveman prompt contract prepended by `review-codex-run`, `review-claude-run`, `review-codex-resume`, and `review-claude-resume`
- `docs/agentic-pipeline-learnings.md` — Prescriptive review/CI pipeline contract + guardrail doc
- `scripts/create-deduped-workflow-failure-issue.sh` — Creates/reuses canonical deduplicated GH Actions failure issue for diagnosis workflow
- `scripts/check-doc-links.sh` — Internal doc link validator for local hooks + CI doc checks
- `scripts/ci-session-store.sh` — Path-naming, pack/unpack, and trailer-parse helper for the per-(agent, issue, run-id) author-session store (job-local under `${RUNNER_TEMP}/ci-sessions/<agent>/<issue>/<run-id>/`); used by both `resolve-issue` (pack + upload) and v2 review-fixer (download + unpack)
- `scripts/test-ci-session-store.sh` — Self-contained unit tests for `ci-session-store.sh`; invoked by `review-fixer-resume-smoke.yml`
- `scripts/run-required-checks.sh` — Canonical local/CI runner for required script, doc, and workflow validations (no OpenClaw config mode)
- `scripts/security-update.sh` — Security update automation
- `scripts/validate-gh-cli-usage.sh` — GitHub CLI workflow usage validation
- `scripts/validate-pr-tests-workflow.sh` — PR Tests workflow actionlint/setup-order validation
- `scripts/validate-workflow-refs.sh` — Workflow reference validation
- `scripts/validate-mermaid.sh`, `scripts/lint-mermaid-rendering.sh` — Diagram validation
- `setup/model-tiers.json` — Repo metadata mapping expensive, medium, and cheap model tiers; read by `app/models.py` at startup
- `pyproject.toml` — Python 3.12 dependency manifest for the LangGraph stack; runtime and dev deps pinned by version
- `.github/workflows/python-validation.yml` — Required CI gate: runs on every PR. The `Python Validation Required` status check always reports. `ruff`, `mypy`, and `pytest-unit` run only when the Python change filter matches `app/`, `migrations/`, `tests/`, `scripts/*.py`, or `pyproject.toml`; they are skipped (and treated as success) on non-Python PRs.
- `.github/workflows/app-image.yml` — Push-to-`main` (filtered on `docker/Dockerfile`, `app/`, `migrations/`, `setup/`, `pyproject.toml`) + `workflow_dispatch`. Builds `docker/Dockerfile` and pushes `ghcr.io/nickborgersprobably/hide-my-list` tagged `:latest` and `:<sha>`, so deployments pull a published artifact instead of building on the host. Pushes only from `main`, never from PR branches — the PR-side build lives in `pr-tests.yml` as the `Docker Build Check` job. `linux/amd64` only: the builder stage compiles against libpq with gcc, so an arm64 leg would run under QEMU emulation.
- `.github/workflows/nightly-evals.yml` — Cron (09:00 UTC) + `workflow_dispatch`. Runs `python -m tests.evals.runner` against current `setup/model-tiers.json` values via the LiteLLM proxy. Runs on a self-hosted `homelab` runner: the proxy is tailnet-only and unreachable from GitHub-hosted runners. Posts `report.md` as a workflow artifact. Budget default $10.
- `.github/workflows/update-signal-cli.yml` — Cron (Mondays 10:00 UTC) + `workflow_dispatch`. Resolves the current `bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api:latest` digest from the registry and opens a PR when it differs from the digest pinned in `docker/compose.yaml`. Separate from `update-ai-clis.yml` because signal-cli is a production runtime dependency rather than CI tooling — bundling them would make a signal-cli fix wait on review of an unrelated CLI bump. Guarded by `tests/unit/test_signal_cli_pin.py`, which pins the compose-file shape the workflow rewrites.
- `.github/workflows/model-swap.yml` — `workflow_dispatch` only. Inputs: candidate_model, candidate_tier, budget_usd. Runs baseline + candidate side-by-side on a self-hosted `homelab` runner; surfaces comparison in job summary. Budget default $15. Use before swapping a tier in `setup/model-tiers.json`.
- `.github/scripts/review/prompts/test.md` — Test coverage reviewer: enforces 6 test-rig contract clauses on PRs touching app/**, migrations/**, setup/model-tiers.json, app/prompts/**, docs/ai-prompts/**, tests/**, the test reviewer prompt, review schemas, docs/python-rewrite/test-rig.md, and docker/compose.yaml
- `.github/scripts/review/prompts/security-breadth.md` — Vendored Anthropic security audit prompt (breadth lens of the two-lens security reviewer). Pin lives in `.github/ci/vendored-prompts.env`; refreshed weekly by `update-ai-clis.yml`.
- `.github/scripts/review/prompts/security-narrow.md` — Repo-specific security invariants (narrow lens). Constrained tool surface, no-shell-out-from-app, private-data placeholder rule, workflow permissions, CI runtime correctness, reviewer-routing regressions.
- `.github/scripts/review/security-merge.mjs` — Deterministic merger that collapses the two security lens artifacts into the canonical `role=security` reviewer artifact the judge consumes. Applies the exclusion filter, confidence demotion, dedup, and 5-blocking + 5-non-blocking cap.
- `.github/ci/vendored-prompts.env` — SHA pin for vendored upstream prompts (currently just the Anthropic security audit prompt).
- `.github/scripts/vendor-security-prompt.py` — Refresh script invoked by `update-ai-clis.yml` to regenerate the vendored block in `security-breadth.md` against a new upstream SHA.

## Safety

- **NEVER touch firewall rules.** Critical security. No exceptions.
- Don't exfiltrate data.
- **Don't leak private examples in GitHub issues, PRs, commits, or review-pipeline artifacts.** This is a public repo. Do not name real people, real recipient phone numbers, real reminder content, real Notion page titles, or real personal events in issues, PR descriptions, commit messages, code comments, or review-pipeline artifacts (review comments, fix-attempt summaries). State the technical problem and desired fix; use placeholder content (`<page_id>`, `<recipient>`, `"Test message"`, etc.). If a specific date/time is load-bearing, keep the date but omit the personal context.
- `trash` > `rm`.

### Prompt & Spec Files — Present Tense Only

The spec and contract files listed in "Spec & Contract Files" above define system behavior. Write them like a system prompt, not a changelog.

Rules:

- **Present tense only.** Describe how the system behaves *right now*. No "now does X", "previously Y", "used to Z", "still [uses old approach]" (historical comparisons). Present-state uses of "still" ("while still running", "agents still control") are fine.
- **No `(Issue #N)` / `(PR #N)` / `(#N)` suffixes** on section headers, list items, or callouts. Issue and PR numbers go in the commit message, the PR body, the linked issue itself — not in the runtime prompt.
- **Replace, don't diff.** When behavior changes, rewrite the section. Don't keep before/after framing or "Why we changed this:" notes in the spec — that belongs in the commit message.
- **No roadmaps in spec files.** In-flight tracking belongs in GitHub issues/projects.
- **Rationale belongs in present tense.** "Why this design:" framing is fine — explain the constraint that *currently* governs the choice.

This rule applies to: `docs/ai-prompts/*.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/task-lifecycle.md`, `docs/notion-schema.md`, `docs/user-interactions.md`, `docs/user-preferences.md`, `docs/reward-system.md`, `design/adhd-priorities.md`.

It does **not** apply to `docs/agentic-pipeline-learnings.md` or other contributor/CI-only guidance, which legitimately carry historical context.

## Review Pipeline

PRs reviewed by multi-agent review pipeline (Codex reviewers + fixer in v2). Roles same in both versions; orchestration differs.

Reviewers handle Markdown spec changes and Python source changes (`app/`, `migrations/`, `tests/`). The classifier (`review-classify` action) detects which file classes are present and routes accordingly. Python source files (`app/**/*.py`, `migrations/*.sql`, `tests/**/*.py`) always trigger security review; `app/prompts/*.md.j2` triggers prompt + psych review.

**Reviewer roles**:
1. Design Review — validates intent + design quality; runs docs-as-spec consistency check on spec-critical changes; evaluates Python module design, async correctness, LangGraph node patterns, constrained-tool-surface invariant
2. Security & Infrastructure Review — two-lens orchestrator. **Breadth lens** (`security-breadth.md`, vendored from [anthropics/claude-code-security-review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review) at the SHA pinned in `.github/ci/vendored-prompts.env`, refreshed weekly by `update-ai-clis.yml`) covers canonical web/agent vuln categories (injection, auth, crypto, deserialization, data exposure) with a confidence ≥0.7 threshold and an exclusion list (DoS, rate-limit, resource leaks, open-redirect, regex injection, non-applicable memory safety, SSRF in HTML, `.md`-file findings). **Narrow lens** (`security-narrow.md`) covers repo-specific invariants the external prompt can't know: constrained `httpx` tool surface (prompt-injection containment), no-shell-out from `app/`, private-data placeholder rule in logs, GH Actions `permissions:` least-privilege, CI runtime correctness, reviewer-routing regressions. Both lenses run as ordinary reviewers and upload `reviewer-security-{breadth,narrow}-<sha>` artifacts. The JUDGE (running from `main`'s checkout with read-only permissions) imports `security-merge.mjs` and synthesizes the canonical `reviewer-security-<sha>` verdict before calling `aggregate()` — closing the script-trust attack class. See `docs/agentic-pipeline-learnings.md` §1.18 and `.github/scripts/review/security-merge.mjs`.
3. Psych Research Review — validates against ADHD clinical research; evaluates `app/prompts/*.md.j2` for banned-phrase regex + shame-safety contract
4. Prompt Engineering Review — validates prompt clarity, constraints, cross-prompt consistency; evaluates `app/prompts/*.md.j2` for prompt-parity contract (section headings from `docs/ai-prompts/` source present in template)
5. Documentation Consistency Review — contradictions, stale refs, cross-doc consistency; includes `docs/python-rewrite/*.md` and Python Runtime Files listed in this file
6. Test Coverage Review — enforces test-rig maintenance per `docs/python-rewrite/test-rig.md`. Fires on the test-rig surface (app/, migrations/, setup/model-tiers.json, app/prompts/, docs/ai-prompts/, tests/, the test reviewer prompt itself, test-rig.md, and the review schemas). Blocks PRs that add public functions without integration tests, modify prompts without updating eval fixtures, add migrations without next-prefix discipline, add env vars/services without smoke-test assertions, or fix production bugs without a `tests/regressions/bug_<NNNN>_<slug>/` entry. Read-only — emits JSON verdict only; no auto-fix.
7. Judge / Merge Decision — synthesizes all reviews into verdict

Lives in `.github/workflows/review-entry.yml`, dispatches `review-pipeline.yml` (orchestrator) → `review-reviewer.yml` (matrix) → `review-fixer.yml` → `review-judge.yml` → `review-finalize.yml`. Judge = deterministic Node script (`.github/scripts/review/aggregate.mjs`) with `permissions: contents: read` — cannot push by construction. Fixer runs after reviewers, before judge; pushes new commit first, then claims that SHA on `review/pipeline` immediately after push (GitHub rejects status for unpublished commit); only stage with write permission. The fixer also attempts `git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/main` before invoking the agent so AI-authored PRs stay mergeable without a human in the loop — clean merges seal on the host, conflicts go through the agent for marker resolution, unresolved conflicts abort the merge and label `needs-human-review`. Verdicts binary **GO** / **NO-GO**; NO-GO labels PR `needs-human-review`, stops without closing or auto-creating issues. Reviewer prompts = standalone files in `.github/scripts/review/prompts/`. See `docs/agentic-pipeline-learnings.md` §1.4 + §1.5 for design decisions.

### Author-resume in the fixer stage

`resolve-issue` accepts both **Codex** and **Claude Code** as first-class authors (selected per run via `/autoresolve <agent>` comment, `agent:codex` / `agent:claude` issue label, or repo default). The author's session state is bind-mounted from a job-local directory during the author run, then packed (`scripts/ci-session-store.sh pack`) and uploaded as the `author-session-<agent>-<run-id>` workflow artifact so it can travel between ephemeral runners. The author writes an `Author-Session: <agent>/<run-id>` trailer into the PR body.

When `review-fixer.yml` runs, `Parse Author-Session trailer` extracts `<agent>/<run-id>`, `Download author session artifact` (`actions/download-artifact@v4` with `run-id` cross-run lookup; requires `actions: read`) fetches the tarball from the original `resolve-issue` run, and `Detect author session for resume` unpacks + validates it. Three-way dispatch:
- **`codex-resume`** → `review-codex-resume` action runs `codex exec resume --last` against the unpacked session
- **`claude-resume`** → `review-claude-resume` action runs `claude --continue`
- **`fallback`** → existing `review-claude-run` (fresh Claude session) — used for human-authored PRs and any case where the trailer is absent, the artifact is missing/expired, or unpack fails validation

The resumed author re-enters the same conversation it had while authoring, this time with `${REVIEWER_ARTIFACTS_DIR}` available in scope. Because it has full context for the choices it originally made, it can revisit those choices instead of patching surface-level symptoms. Reviewers + judge always run regardless of dispatch mode — backstop catches anything the resumed author misses.

Symmetric two-agent support means the fixer must understand both `codex exec resume` and `claude --continue` semantics; `fixer-resume.md` is the shared prompt loaded by both resume actions.

### Review prompt file architecture

Reviewer prompts (`.github/scripts/review/prompts/{design,security-breadth,security-narrow,psych,docs,prompt,test}.md`) **self-contained** — each reviewer loads only its own `${role}.md` at runtime. Codex CLI doesn't support markdown includes. The security role is split across two prompt files because the lenses serve disjoint purposes (vendored breadth catalog vs. repo-specific invariants) and the merger script — not the LLM — is responsible for collapsing them.

Constraint applies to all reviewers → add to each prompt file individually. Use identical wording across files unless structure requires different phrasing (e.g., inline JSON placeholder vs. prose). Same applies to `fixer.md` — loaded independently.

"Sibling files with shared contract, loaded independently" pattern recurs throughout repo (e.g., spec files). Editing one file in group → check if siblings need same change.

## When Making Changes

- Spec docs define agent behavior — changing those docs changes system behavior; reviewed as behavioral changes
- Psych reviewer validates user-facing changes against ADHD research
- `config_only` infra/CI changes skip psych review automatically; prompt-bearing reviewer/config markdown follows specialist review path
- All changes go through PR with full review pipeline
