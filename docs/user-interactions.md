# User Interactions

## Overview

All interactions in hide-my-list happen via natural language. AI determines intent from message and responds. This doc covers all conversation flows.

## Intent Detection

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Message([User Message]) --> Detect[AI Intent Detection]

    Detect --> AddTask["ADD_TASK<br/>Adding new task"]
    Detect --> GetTask["GET_TASK<br/>Ready to work"]
    Detect --> Complete["COMPLETE<br/>Finished task"]
    Detect --> Reject["REJECT<br/>Don't want this task"]
    Detect --> CannotFinish["CANNOT_FINISH<br/>Task too large"]
    Detect --> NeedHelp["NEED_HELP<br/>Wants breakdown assistance"]
    Detect --> CheckIn["CHECK_IN<br/>System follow-up"]
    Detect --> Chat["CHAT<br/>General conversation"]

    AddTask --> IntakeFlow[Task Intake Flow]

### Intent Signal Examples

| Intent | Example Messages |
|--------|------------------|
| ADD_TASK | "I need to...", "Add...", "Remind me to...", "New task:", "Ping me at 6pm to..." |
| GET_TASK | "I have X minutes", "What should I do?", "I'm ready to work" |
| COMPLETE | "Done", "Finished", "Completed", "I did it" |
| REJECT | "Not that one", "Something else", "I don't want to" |
| CANNOT_FINISH | "This is too big", "I can't finish this", "Too much for one sitting" |
| NEED_HELP | "How do I start?", "What should I do first?", "I'm stuck", "Break this down" |
| CHECK_IN | System-initiated (runtime follow-up, not user message) |
| CHAT | "Hello", "How does this work?", "What's in my list?" |

## Flow 1: Task Intake

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant N as Notion

    U->>AI: "I need to review Sarah's proposal"

    Note over AI: Parse task, infer ALL labels
    Note over AI: Inferred: focus work, ~30 min, urgency 50

    AI->>N: Create task with inferred labels
    N-->>AI: Task created
    AI->>U: "Got it — focus work, ~30 min, moderate priority.<br/>Plan: 1) Read intro, 2) Check numbers, 3) Note concerns, 4) Draft feedback"

    Note over U,AI: Vague task example

    U->>AI: "Take care of that thing from yesterday"

    Note over AI: Task too vague — cannot identify what the task is
    Note over AI: Clarification 1 of max 3

    AI->>U: "Which thing from yesterday?"
    U->>AI: "The proposal review for Sarah"

    Note over AI: Now clear — infer labels and save

    AI->>N: Create task with inferred labels
    N-->>AI: Task created
    AI->>U: "Got it — focus work, ~30 min, moderate priority.<br/>Plan: 1) Read intro, 2) Check numbers, 3) Note concerns, 4) Draft feedback"
```

> **Decision Fatigue Prevention:** System prefers inference over questions. All labels (urgency, time, work type) inferred from context — never asked. When task too vague to identify (e.g., "do the thing"), up to 3 simple clarifying questions, one at a time. User can correct after ("actually that's urgent") but never forced to decide on labels.
> See [Issue #11](https://github.com/NickBorgersProbably/hide-my-list/issues/11).

### Intake Flow (Inference-First, Questions as Last Resort)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User describes task]) --> Parse[AI parses description]
    Parse --> Infer[Infer ALL labels aggressively]
    Infer --> Clear{Task clear enough?}
    Clear -->|Yes| Save[Save to Notion with defaults]
    Clear -->|No, too vague| AskCount{Questions asked < 3?}
    AskCount -->|Yes| Ask[Ask ONE clarifying question]
    AskCount -->|No, limit reached| Save
    Ask --> UserAnswer[User answers]
    UserAnswer --> Infer
    Save --> Confirm([Confirm with inferred labels])
    Confirm --> Correction{User corrects?}
    Correction -->|Yes| Update[Update task]
    Correction -->|No / Moves on| Done([Done])
```

### All Tasks Are Quick Capture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Always["Clear Tasks (Inferred Immediately)"]
        Q1["User: #quot;Call mom#quot;"] --> Q2["AI: #quot;Got it — social, ~15 min, low priority#quot;"]
        Q3["User: #quot;Work on the project#quot;"] --> Q4["AI: #quot;Got it — focus, ~45 min, moderate priority.<br/>First step: outline the key sections.#quot;"]
    end

    subgraph Clarify["Vague Tasks (Ask to Clarify)"]
        V1["User: #quot;Handle that thing#quot;"] --> V2["AI: #quot;Which thing are you thinking of?#quot;"]
        V3["User: #quot;The email to the team#quot;"] --> V4["AI: #quot;Got it — social, ~15 min, moderate priority.#quot;"]
    end

    subgraph Correction["User Can Correct (Optional)"]
        C1["User: #quot;Actually that's urgent#quot;"] --> C2["AI: #quot;Updated to high priority.#quot;"]
    end
```

## Flow 2: Task Selection

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant N as Notion

    U->>AI: "I have 20 minutes and feeling tired"

    Note over AI: Parse: time=20, mood=tired→independent

    AI->>N: Query pending tasks
    N-->>AI: Return 8 pending tasks

    Note over AI: Score each task
    Note over AI: Best match: "Organize receipts" (score: 0.87)

    AI->>U: "How about organizing your receipts from last week? It's low-energy admin work and should take about 15 minutes."

    alt User accepts
        U->>AI: "Sure"
        AI->>N: Update status → in_progress
        AI->>U: "Great, it's yours. Let me know when you're done!"
    else User rejects
        U->>AI: "Not that one"
        Note over AI: Start rejection flow
    end
```

### Selection Decision Tree

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Request([User requests task]) --> ParseContext[Parse time + mood]
    ParseContext --> FetchTasks[Fetch pending tasks]
    FetchTasks --> HasTasks{Any tasks?}

    HasTasks -->|No| NoTasks["Your slate is clear!<br/>Want to add something?"]
    HasTasks -->|Yes| FilterTime[Filter by time constraint]

    FilterTime --> HasMatches{Any fit time?}
    HasMatches -->|No| NoFit["Nothing fits that timeframe.<br/>Got more time?"]
    HasMatches -->|Yes| ScoreTasks[Score remaining tasks]

    ScoreTasks --> BestScore{Best score > 0.5?}
    BestScore -->|Yes| Suggest[Suggest task confidently]
    BestScore -->|No| Unsure["Nothing's a perfect match.<br/>Want to try X anyway?"]

    Suggest --> Present([Present to user])
```

### Mood Interpretation

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["User Says"]
        I1["focused / in the zone / sharp"]
        I2["creative / inspired / brainstormy"]
        I3["social / energetic / chatty"]
        I4["tired / low energy / drained"]
        I5["stressed / anxious / overwhelmed"]
    end

    subgraph Output["Best Work Type"]
        O1[Focus Work]
        O2[Creative Work]
        O3[Social Work]
        O4[Independent/Admin]
        O5[Independent/Admin]
    end

    I1 --> O1
    I2 --> O2
    I3 --> O3
    I4 --> O4
    I5 --> O5
```

## Flow 3: Task Completion

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant R as Reward Engine
    participant N as Notion
    participant HA as Home Audio
    participant SMS as SMS Service

    U->>AI: "Done!"

    AI->>N: Update task status → completed
    AI->>N: Set completedAt timestamp
    N-->>AI: Success

    AI->>R: Trigger reward evaluation
    R->>R: Calculate intensity score

    par Parallel Reward Delivery
        R->>AI: Emoji + AI-generated image
        R->>HA: Play victory music
        R->>SMS: Text significant other
    end

    AI->>U: "CRUSHED IT! 🔥💪✨ [unique AI celebration image]"

    Note over HA: "We Are The Champions" plays

    alt High intensity achievement
        R->>AI: Generate outing suggestion
        AI->>U: "You've earned it! Coffee at Luna Cafe? ☕"
    end

    alt User provides feedback
        U->>AI: "Easier than expected"
        Note over AI: Reduce time estimate for similar tasks
        AI->>U: "Good to know - I'll remember that. Ready for another?"
    else User skips
        U->>AI: "Next task"
        AI->>U: "What's your energy like now?"
    end
```

### Reward Delivery System

Completion triggers multi-channel reward system to maximize dopamine delivery:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Done(["User: #quot;Done!#quot;"]) --> Evaluate[Evaluate Achievement]

    Evaluate --> Score[Calculate Intensity Score]
    Score --> Level{Intensity Level}

    Level -->|Low| LowReward["Emoji only<br/>#quot;Nice! ✨#quot;"]
    Level -->|Medium| MedReward["Emoji + AI image<br/>#quot;Crushing it! 🎉💪#quot;"]
    Level -->|High| HighReward[Emoji + AI image + Music + Text SO]
    Level -->|Epic| EpicReward[All rewards + AI Video + Outing]

    subgraph SystemRewards["System-Generated Rewards"]
        Emoji[Emoji Explosion]
        AIImage[AI-Generated Image<br/>Unique per completion]
        
        Music[Home Audio Playback<br/>Sonos/HomePod/Echo]
    end

    subgraph InterpersonalRewards["Interpersonal Rewards"]
        TextSO["Text Significant Other<br/>#quot;Your partner crushed a big task!#quot;"]
        Outing["Suggest Fun Outing<br/>#quot;Coffee at your favorite spot?#quot;"]
    end

    HighReward --> SystemRewards
    HighReward --> InterpersonalRewards
    EpicReward --> SystemRewards
    EpicReward --> InterpersonalRewards
```

### Intensity Scoring

| Factor | Weight | Examples |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Task difficulty | 30% | Time estimate, energy required |
| Current streak | 25% | 3+ tasks = bonus |
| Task type | 20% | Parent complete = major bonus |
| Time of day | 15% | End of day = bonus |
| Recent history | 10% | Diminishing returns if many recent rewards |

### Completion Feedback Loop

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Done(["User: #quot;Done!#quot;"]) --> Update[Update Notion]
    Update --> Reward[Trigger Reward Engine]

    Reward --> SessionCheck{First completion today?}

    SessionCheck -->|Yes| Celebrate["FIRST ONE DOWN! 🎯✨"]
    SessionCheck -->|No| Streak["That's 3 done today! 🔥💪🎉"]

    Celebrate --> DeliverRewards
    Streak --> DeliverRewards

    DeliverRewards[Deliver Multi-Channel Rewards] --> Feedback

    Feedback{Ask for feedback?}
    Feedback -->|Sometimes| Ask["How did that feel?"]
    Feedback -->|Often| Skip[Skip to next prompt]

    Ask --> Easier[Easier than expected]
    Ask --> Right[About right]
    Ask --> Harder[Harder than expected]
    Ask --> NoAnswer[User ignores]

    Easier --> LearnEasy[Reduce time estimates]
    Right --> NoChange[Keep estimates]
    Harder --> LearnHard[Increase estimates]
    NoAnswer --> Continue

    LearnEasy --> Continue
    NoChange --> Continue
    LearnHard --> Continue

    Skip --> Continue{Continue working?}
    Continue -->|Yes| NextTask[Get another task]
    Continue -->|No| OutingCheck{High intensity?}
    OutingCheck -->|Yes| SuggestOuting["You've earned a break!<br/>How about [favorite_activity]?"]
    OutingCheck -->|No| End([End session])
    SuggestOuting --> End
```

## Flow 4: Task Rejection

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant N as Notion

    AI->>U: "How about the quarterly report?"
    U->>AI: "Not that one"

    AI->>U: "No problem — that helps me learn what works for you. What's steering you away?"
    U->>AI: "Not in the mood for deep work"

    Note over AI: Record: mood mismatch for focus work

    AI->>N: Update rejectionNotes
    AI->>N: Increment rejectionCount

    Note over AI: Re-score with mood constraint

    AI->>U: "Got it. How about organizing your inbox? Still productive but lighter work."
```

### Rejection Reason Categories

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Reject([User rejects]) --> Why["What's steering you away?"]

    Why --> TooLong["Takes too long"]
    Why --> WrongMood["Not in the mood"]
    Why --> Blocked["Waiting on something"]
    Why --> AlreadyDone["Already done"]
    Why --> NotFeeling["Just not feeling it"]

    TooLong --> ActionTime[Suggest shorter task<br/>Consider adjusting estimate]
    WrongMood --> ActionMood[Suggest different work type<br/>Remember mood preference]
    Blocked --> ActionBlock[Mark task as blocked<br/>Don't suggest until unblocked]
    AlreadyDone --> ActionDone[Mark task completed<br/>Celebrate the win!]
    NotFeeling --> ActionGeneral[Log rejection<br/>Try different task]
```

### Rejection Escalation (Shame-Safe)

> **Shame Prevention:** Multiple rejections = highest-risk shame moment. Each escalation must explicitly normalize. Never frame rejection accumulation as problem.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    R1[1st Rejection] --> Suggest1["Suggest alternative<br/>'No problem — here's something different'"]
    Suggest1 --> R2[2nd Rejection]
    R2 --> Suggest2["Very different task + normalize<br/>'Your no's help me learn — trying something else'"]
    Suggest2 --> R3[3rd Rejection]
    R3 --> Normalize["Explicit normalization<br/>'Sometimes the brain just isn't in task mode.<br/>That's not a failure — it's information.'"]
    Normalize --> Offer["Offer choice:<br/>describe what sounds good OR take a break"]
    Offer -->|Describes mood| CustomSearch[Search with explicit criteria]
    Offer -->|Break| SafeExit["'I'll be here when you're ready.<br/>No pressure, no judgment.'"]
    CustomSearch --> R4{4th+ Rejection?}
    R4 -->|Yes| SafeExit
    R4 -->|No| Continue[Continue suggesting]
```

## Flow 5: Cannot Finish (Task Breakdown)

User says cannot finish → task too large, needs sub-tasks. **AI must first acknowledge progress, then ask what they accomplished** to understand what remains.

> **Shame Prevention:** "Cannot finish" is high-risk. User admitting they couldn't do something. Always lead with acknowledging effort and reframe: they didn't fail — they discovered task's real size. Valuable info.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant N as Notion

    AI->>U: "How about working on the Q4 marketing plan?"
    U->>AI: "I started but this is too big to finish"

    Note over AI: CANNOT_FINISH detected

    AI->>U: "No worries — you figured out it's bigger than it seemed. What did you get into?"
    U->>AI: "I drafted the outline and did initial research"

    Note over AI: Analyze: Outline + research done<br/>Writing and analysis remain

    AI->>N: Create sub-tasks for remainder (hidden)
    AI->>N: Update parent task with progress notes

    Note over N: Hidden sub-tasks created:<br/>1. Write executive summary<br/>2. Draft competitive analysis<br/>3. Finalize recommendations

    AI->>U: "Real progress — outline and research are done. Ready to tackle the executive summary? Should take about 30 min."
```

### Cannot Finish Decision Tree

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    CannotFinish(["User: #quot;This is too big#quot;"]) --> AskProgress["Ask: What did you accomplish?"]
    AskProgress --> UserDescribes[User describes progress]
    UserDescribes --> Analyze[Analyze remaining work]
    Analyze --> HasSubtasks{Already has sub-tasks?}

    HasSubtasks -->|Yes| UpdateProgress[Update completed sub-tasks]
    HasSubtasks -->|No| CreateSubtasks[Break remainder into sub-tasks]

    UpdateProgress --> RemainingTooLarge{Remaining sub-task too large?}
    RemainingTooLarge -->|Yes| BreakFurther[Break into smaller chunks]
    RemainingTooLarge -->|No| OfferNext[Offer next sub-task]

    CreateSubtasks --> InferBreakdown[AI infers logical breakdown<br/>based on what remains]
    InferBreakdown --> SaveHidden[Save sub-tasks to Notion<br/>Hidden from user]

    BreakFurther --> SaveHidden
    SaveHidden --> OfferFirst[Offer first remaining sub-task]

    OfferNext --> Present([Present manageable task])
    OfferFirst --> Present
```

### Breakdown Strategy

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Input["Original Task"]
        Big["Complete the project"]
    end

    subgraph Analysis["AI Analysis"]
        Scope[Identify scope]
        Phases[Determine phases]
        FirstAction[Find first actionable step]
    end

    subgraph Output["Hidden Sub-tasks"]
        S1["Complete first revision"]
        S2["Get initial feedback"]
        S3["Incorporate revisions"]
        S4["Final review"]
    end

    Input --> Scope
    Scope --> Phases
    Phases --> FirstAction
    FirstAction --> S1
    S1 -.-> S2
    S2 -.-> S3
    S3 -.-> S4
```

**Key Principles:**
- Sub-task breakdown NEVER shown to user as full list
- Each sub-task completable in one sitting (15-90 min)
- AI presents only current actionable sub-task
- Parent task completes only when all sub-tasks done

### Cannot Finish Response Templates (Shame-Safe)

| Scenario | Response Template |
|----------|-------------------|
| First time | "Now we know this task's real size. I've broken it into smaller pieces — ready for the first chunk?" |
| Already broken | "Still too big — that's useful info. Let me find an even smaller piece to start with." |
| Can't break further | "This is pretty focused already. What's the specific part that's hard?" |
| Making progress | "Nice — one piece done! Ready for the next bit?" |

---

## Flow 6: Breakdown Assistance (On-Demand Help)

Core principle: **users interpret vague goals as infinite, so avoid them.** Agent must always help users know exactly what to do next.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant

    AI->>U: "How about writing the project proposal?"
    U->>AI: "Sure"
    AI->>U: "Great! Here's the plan:<br/>1. Open a new doc<br/>2. Write the problem statement (2-3 sentences)<br/>3. List 3 proposed solutions<br/>4. Add timeline estimate<br/>Start with step 1 - let me know when you're ready for the next!"

    Note over U,AI: User works on step 1

    U->>AI: "What's next?"
    AI->>U: "Step 2: Write the problem statement. Just 2-3 sentences describing what needs solving. What's the main issue this project addresses?"
```

### Breakdown Assistance Decision Tree

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User needs help]) --> HasActive{Has active task?}

    HasActive -->|Yes| Analyze[Analyze where user is stuck]
    HasActive -->|No| GetTask[Suggest getting a task first]

    Analyze --> StuckType{What kind of stuck?}

    StuckType -->|"How do I start?"| FirstStep[Provide exact first action]
    StuckType -->|"What are all the steps?"| ShowPlan[Show numbered steps]
    StuckType -->|"This step is too big"| BreakStep[Break current step smaller]
    StuckType -->|"I don't understand"| Clarify[Explain the step differently]

    FirstStep --> Specific["Open your browser and go to [specific URL]"]
    ShowPlan --> Numbered["1. Do X (5 min)<br/>2. Do Y (10 min)<br/>3. Do Z (5 min)"]
    BreakStep --> Smaller["Let's make that smaller:<br/>First, just [micro-action]"]
    Clarify --> Rephrase["Here's another way to think about it..."]
```

### Proactive Assistance Triggers

Agent proactively offers breakdown when it detects:

| Signal | Agent Response |
|--------|----------------|
| Long pause after accepting task | "Need help getting started? I can break this down further." |
| "Hmm" / "Uh" / hesitation words | "Want me to walk you through the steps?" |
| "I guess" / uncertain acceptance | "Let me give you a clear starting point..." |
| User returns without completing | "Picking this back up? Here's where you left off and what's next." |

### Assistance Response Levels

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Level1["Level 1: Overview"]
        L1["Here are the 4 steps..."]
    end

    subgraph Level2["Level 2: Current Step"]
        L2["Focus on step 2: Do X"]
    end

    subgraph Level3["Level 3: Micro-Action"]
        L3["Right now, just open the file"]
    end

    subgraph Level4["Level 4: Hand-Holding"]
        L4["Click File > New > Document"]
    end

    Level1 --> Level2 --> Level3 --> Level4
```

Agent adjusts detail by user signals:
- Confident → Level 1-2
- Uncertain → Level 2-3
- Stuck → Level 3-4
- Very stuck → Level 4 + encouragement

### Assistance Conversation Examples

**User needs starting help:**
```
User: "Sure, I'll do the proposal"
AI: "Perfect! Let's make this concrete:
     1. Open Google Docs and create a new file
     2. Title it 'Project Proposal - [Date]'
     3. Write one sentence: What problem are you solving?

     Just do step 1 right now. Ready when you are!"
```

**User stuck mid-task:**
```
User: "I'm stuck on this"
AI: "No problem - where did you get to? Tell me the last thing you finished and I'll point you to the exact next action."
```

**User wants the full picture:**
```
User: "What are all the steps?"
AI: "Here's the full breakdown:
     1. Problem statement (5 min) ← you are here
     2. Solution options (10 min)
     3. Timeline (5 min)
     4. Quick review (5 min)

     Total: ~25 min. Want to start with the problem statement?"
```

---

## Flow 7: Check-In Follow-Up

User accepts task → agent records in Notion + stores timing metadata in `state.json`. OpenClaw's optional `task-check-in` cron re-enters conversation if task runs long. If cron not configured, proactive check-ins disabled.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant AI as AI Assistant
    participant State as state.json
    participant Cron as OpenClaw Cron<br/>(task-check-in)
    participant N as Notion

    U->>AI: "Sure, I'll do that"
    AI->>N: Update status → in_progress
    AI->>State: Save active_task (id, title, estimate, started_at, check_in_due_at)
    AI->>U: "Great, it's yours. Let me know when you're done!"

    Note over AI,Cron: Time passes

    Cron->>AI: Trigger (if configured)
    AI->>State: Load active_task + check_in_due_at
    AI->>AI: Is check-in due?
    alt Not due / no task
        AI->>State: Optional cleanup
        AI-->>Cron: CHECK_IN_SKIPPED
    else Due and still in progress
        AI->>N: Confirm task still in_progress
        N-->>AI: Still active

    end

    alt User completed
        U->>AI: "Oh yeah, finished that!"
        AI->>N: Update status → completed
        AI->>State: Clear active_task, reset conversation_state
    else User still working
        U->>AI: "Still working on it"
        AI->>State: Update check_in_due_at = now + estimate×0.5
        AI->>State: Increment check_in_count
        AI->>U: "No rush — keep at it! I'll check back in a bit."
    else User got distracted
        U->>AI: "Ugh, got distracted"
        AI->>U: "Happens to everyone. Want to jump back in?"
        alt User says yes
            AI->>State: Update check_in_due_at = now + estimate×0.5
            AI->>State: Increment check_in_count
        else User says no
            AI->>State: Clear active_task
        end
    else User needs more time
        U->>AI: "Need another 20 minutes"
        AI->>U: "No problem — I'll check back then."
        AI->>State: Set check_in_due_at = now + (20 × 1.25)
    else User wants to stop
        U->>AI: "Let me do something else"
        AI->>N: Update status → pending
        AI->>State: Clear active_task
        AI->>U: "Got it — back in the queue. What sounds good now?"
    end
```

### Check-In Response Templates (Shame-Safe)

> **Shame Prevention:** Check-ins can feel like surveillance. Tone = curious, warm — friend checking in, not manager. Never imply user should have finished by now.

| Scenario | AI Response |
|----------|-------------|
| 1st check-in | "How's [task] going? Still at it?" |
| 2nd check-in | "Still working on [task]? No rush either way." |
| 3rd check-in | "Want to take a break from [task]? Totally fine — I'll be here when you're ready." |
| User says done | "Nice! Marking that off. Ready for another?" |
| User still working | "No rush — keep at it! I'll check back in a bit." |
| User got distracted | "Happens to literally everyone. Want to jump back in, or try something else?" |
| User needs more time | "No problem — time estimates are just guesses anyway. About how much longer?" |
| User wants to stop | "Totally fine — I'll keep it for later. No pressure. What sounds good instead?" |

### OpenClaw Scheduling

No browser timer. Use OpenClaw infrastructure:

- **Recommended cron:** `task-check-in` every 5 minutes, durable.
- **Session payload:** Prompt instructs agent to load `state.json` and evaluate `check_in_due_at`.
- **Early exit:** If due time not reached, reply `CHECK_IN_SKIPPED` for observability.
- **State fields:** `active_task.id`, `active_task.title`, `active_task.time_estimate`, `active_task.started_at`, `active_task.check_in_due_at`, `active_task.check_in_count`.

If cron not configured, agent must not attempt proactive check-ins. Rest of flow valid for future deployment.

## Flow 8: Scheduled Reminder Delivery

Reminders = tasks with specific wall-clock delivery time. Unlike check-ins (active-task state + optional OpenClaw), reminders fire proactively even when chat idle.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Cron as Isolated Cheap-Tier Cron
    participant Scr as check-reminders.sh
    participant Notion as Notion API
    participant Signal as .reminder-signal
    participant State as state.json
    participant Delivery as Heartbeat / Main Session
    participant User

    Cron->>Scr: Run check-reminders.sh
    Scr->>Notion: Query due reminders (remind_at <= now)
    Notion-->>Scr: Due reminder tasks
    Scr->>Signal: Write reminder handoff file
    Note over Cron: Cron exits (NO_REPLY)
    alt User interacts (AGENTS.md step 5)
        Delivery->>Signal: Validate handoff file
        Delivery->>User: Send reminder via message tool
        Delivery->>State: Save recent_outbound reminder context
        Delivery->>Notion: complete-reminder(sent|missed)
        Delivery->>Signal: Delete handoff file
    else Heartbeat runs (Check 1)
        Delivery->>Signal: Validate handoff file
        Delivery->>User: Send reminder via message tool
        Delivery->>State: Save recent_outbound reminder context
        Delivery->>Notion: complete-reminder(sent|missed)
        Delivery->>Signal: Delete handoff file
    end
```

`reminder-check` cron runs as isolated cheap-tier session — query-only, no delivery. Delivery via two paths: main-session startup check (AGENTS.md step 5, on every user interaction) and heartbeat (Check 1 in `docs/heartbeat-checks.md`, every 60 min). Both validate handoff is JSON with `reminders` array where each entry has string `page_id`, non-empty string `title`, `status` exactly `sent` or `missed`. Wrong shape or status = malformed, file stays, delivering session resolves `OPS_ALERT_SIGNAL_NUMBER` from `.env` to concrete Signal recipient and sends ops alert via OpenClaw `message` tool (`action: send`, `channel: signal`, `target: "<resolved OPS_ALERT_SIGNAL_NUMBER>"`), nothing delivered/completed/deleted. On successful delivery, the session also appends/updates `state.json.recent_outbound` with a short-lived reminder entry so the next session can interpret terse replies like "I did it" or "tomorrow at 9" even though the handoff file is gone and the Notion reminder is already completed. Delivery failure = file stays for retry.

### Reminder Reply Continuity

If the next session starts and the user replies to the reminder in shorthand, the agent should use `state.json.recent_outbound` before asking for clarification.

Example:
- Agent sends: "This was due a bit ago — clean up boxes before noon. Want to handle it now or reschedule?"
- User opens a new session and says: "I did it"
- Agent interprets that as completion of "clean up boxes before noon", delivers completion acknowledgment and reward (the reminder Notion page is already Completed at delivery time — no second Notion update), and clears the matched `recent_outbound` entry

### Reminder Delivery Messages

Agent delivers reminders brief, casual — friend tapping your shoulder:

**Approximate delivery (next eligible poll after scheduled time, before missed threshold):**
> "Hey — this is your reminder to email Melanie about availability."

**Missed delivery (>15 minutes past due, flagged as missed):**
> "This was due a bit ago — email Melanie about availability. Want to handle it now or reschedule?"

### Reminder Intake

AI detects reminder-style language and sets:
- `is_reminder = true`
- `remind_at` = full ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone
- `reminder_status = pending`
- `urgency = 90` (time-critical)

**Confirmation message style:**
> "Got it — I'll queue a reminder for 6pm PT to email Melanie. You'll usually hear from me within an hour of that — up to ~75 min if things are quiet — so treat it as a check-in, not a stopwatch."

User timezone defaults to US Central. AI converts timezone references (PT, CT, ET) to UTC offsets at intake.

### Reminder vs. Deadline

Different concepts:
- **Reminder**: "Ping me at 6pm to call Sarah" → proactive notification arriving on the next user conversation or hourly heartbeat after 6pm (typically within an hour of the target, up to ~75 min if the session stays idle)
- **Deadline**: "Review proposal by Friday" → urgency-scored task, no proactive ping

Key signal = notification intent: user wants to be *told* to do something at a specific time, not just prioritized.
