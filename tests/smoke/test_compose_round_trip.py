"""Compose round-trip smoke test.

Boots the full docker-compose stack and exercises a basic round trip.
Catches bug class 5: deployment-gap bugs that unit + integration tests
miss (signal-cli mode, missing transitive deps, setup/ not copied into
image, env vars not threaded through compose).

Gated by `ENABLE_COMPOSE_SMOKE=true`. Default-skip — running this in
every PR CI is too slow + too LLM-expensive.

Privacy: no real user data. Uses placeholder fixtures only.

This test is the ONE allowed `subprocess.run` site outside the
constrained code surface. The tool-surface audit (`test_tool_surface_audit.py`)
explicitly carves out this file.

The app always starts in full-runtime mode (no skeleton/flag mode).
The smoke is a *deployment-gap* test: it asserts the stack comes up
cleanly and that key subsystems (postgres, signal-cli, migrations) are
reachable. App-level behavior is covered by integration and eval layers.
