"""Integration tests for migration 0011: reward_manifests visual descriptors.

Verifies against a real Postgres that the reward feedback loop closes:

  - write_reward_manifest persists theme_family / style / palette.
  - record_reward_feedback attributes an emoji reaction to that row.
  - load_feedback_history returns the descriptors the reaction earned.
  - _select_theme then weights that theme above its peers.

The unit tests mock the DB, so they can only prove the functions agree with each
other. This proves the columns exist, the INSERT and SELECT column lists match
the migration, and the values survive the round trip — the failure modes a
mocked connection cannot see.

Tests require a live DATABASE_URL. Skipped otherwise.

Private data discipline: all identifiers and content use placeholders; no real
page IDs, recipients, or task titles.
