"""Structural lint: public function reachability via AST scan.

Scans app/tools/*.py, app/graph/nodes/*.py, app/scheduler/*.py,
app/ingress/*.py for top-level public functions (no leading '_')
and asserts each name is referenced at least once in any Python file
across the entire app/ tree (including the defining module's own
call sites, but excluding the definition itself).

A function with exactly 1 occurrence across all files (the definition)
has no callers anywhere — that is a dead-code wiring bug (bug class 6).
The most illustrative example: record_reward_feedback in rewards.py existed
with passing unit tests but was never invoked from signal_listener.py.

Conservative by design:
- Only top-level (module-level) functions are checked — nested functions
  and class methods are excluded.
- The _ENTRY_POINTS allowlist covers functions whose sole external caller
  is the entry-point mechanism (APScheduler, main.py), where a naive
  text count reaches 2 (def + assignment in SCHEDULED_JOBS) within the
  same file. Adding a function here means accepting it as a legitimate
  entry point; add a comment explaining why.
- The _KNOWN_DEAD allowlist documents pre-existing dead code that predates
  this test. Removing a name from _KNOWN_DEAD is the right refactor; adding
  new names to this list requires PR justification.
- False positives are worse than misses. If the heuristic flags a real
  reachable function, add it to _ENTRY_POINTS with a comment.

Bug class 6: dead-code wiring.
