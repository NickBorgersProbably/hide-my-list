# Test Rig: hide-my-list Behavioral + LLM-Swap Test Architecture

Authoritative reference for the test rig that enforces behavioral contracts,
catches dead-code wiring, and validates model-swap readiness across the
Python + LangGraph stack.

The rig review enforcer lives at `.github/scripts/review/prompts/test.md` and
fires on every PR that touches `app/**`, `migrations/**`, `setup/model-tiers.json`,
`app/prompts/**`, `docs/ai-prompts/**`, `tests/**`, the test reviewer prompt,
`.github/scripts/review/schema/*.json`, `docs/python-rewrite/test-rig.md`, or
`docker/compose.yaml`.

## Layer Architecture

| Layer | Directory | LLM | Postgres | Compose | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | mocked (`MagicMock`) | none | no | Pure logic, prompt structure, regex/type assertions, structural lints |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | mocked (with strict call-arg assertions) | real (container) | no | State machines, DB schema, async plumbing, wiring contracts |
| Eval | `tests/evals/` | real, multi-model via LiteLLM proxy | none | no | Behavioral contracts across model swaps; judge-LLM scoring |
| Smoke | `tests/smoke/` | none | none | yes (boots stack) | Deployment-gap catch |
| Regressions | `tests/regressions/` | varies | varies | varies | One permanent test per production bug |

### Cost and frequency

| Layer | Wall time | LLM cost | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | <30 s | $0 | every commit |
| Integration | <2 min | $0 | every commit |
| Structural lints | <10 s | $0 | every commit |
| Compose smoke | <3 min | $0 | gated by `ENABLE_COMPOSE_SMOKE=true` — runs on demand only |
| Evals (baseline) | 10-20 min | ~$2-5 | `.github/workflows/nightly-evals.yml` — cron 09:00 UTC + `workflow_dispatch` |
| Model-swap report | 15-30 min | ~$5-10 | `.github/workflows/model-swap.yml` — `workflow_dispatch` only |

CI never sets `ENABLE_LIVE_LLM_EVALS=true` for PRs. The nightly eval workflow
and model-swap workflow run on the self-hosted `homelab` runner (which can reach
the tailnet-only proxy) and provide the required proxy env vars directly — a
non-empty placeholder API key and the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint — rather
than repo secrets. The compose smoke is manually gated by `ENABLE_COMPOSE_SMOKE` —
there's no scheduled trigger (it boots the full stack and is too slow for PR CI).

## The Nine Bug Classes

Each bug class leaves a permanent test. Fix -> regression test ->
`tests/regressions/bug_<NNNN>_<slug>/`. The catalog grows; we don't relearn.

| # | Bug | Where tested | Key assertion |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | psycopg3 UUID coercion | `tests/regressions/bug_0570_reminder_uuid_coercion/test_uuid_round_trip.py` | Insert via `reminders.enqueue`, dispatch, assert no `AttributeError`, `state='delivered'`, correct recipient kwarg |
| 2 | LLM capability denial | `tests/unit/test_no_capability_denial.py` (structural) + `tests/evals/fixtures/chat/missed_reminder.yaml` exercised via `tests/evals/test_evals.py` | `regex_forbid` denial phrasing; judge score >= 0.7 for capability acknowledgment |
| 3 | Image orphaned from delivery | `tests/integration/test_reward_image_delivery.py` (follow-up; tracked in `tests/regressions/bug_0563_reward_image_orphan/README.md`) | `mock.call_args.kwargs["attachment_path"]` is non-None AND file exists; not just `mock.called` |
| 4 | Auth gate | `tests/unit/test_signal_listener_auth.py` | Unauthorized peer rejected; no state-table writes |
| 5 | Deployment gaps | `tests/smoke/test_compose_round_trip.py` | Full compose stack boots; reminder_outbox table created when migrations run; env vars threaded |
| 6 | Dead-code wiring | `tests/unit/test_reachability.py` (AST scan) | Every public top-level function in scanned dirs has >= 1 call site outside its definition |
| 7 | Migration filename collisions | `tests/unit/test_migration_filenames.py` | Unique prefixes, monotonic sequence, format `\d{4}_[a-z][a-z0-9_]*.sql` |
| 8 | mypy suppression sprawl | `tests/unit/test_mypy_suppression_budget.py` | Count of `ignore_errors = true` overrides matches frozen baseline; can only shrink |
| 9 | Production dependency pin staleness | `tests/unit/test_signal_cli_pin.py` | Image pinned by immutable digest AND a scheduled refresh workflow exists and targets the same image |

## Structural Lints (unit speed, always runs)

Six lints in `tests/unit/` that run without LLM or Postgres. Five catch five
of the nine bug classes directly; one ensures the pre-commit Python gate stays
wired.

### `test_migration_filenames.py`

Globs `migrations/*.sql`, parses the `^\d+_` prefix, asserts:
- All prefixes are unique (no duplicate `0005_*.sql`).
- Prefixes are monotonic starting at 1 with no gaps.
- Filenames match `^\d{4}_[a-z][a-z0-9_]*\.sql$`.

### `test_reachability.py`

AST-scans `app/tools/*.py`, `app/graph/nodes/*.py`, `app/scheduler/*.py`,
`app/ingress/*.py` for top-level public functions (no leading `_`). For each
function, counts total occurrences (word-boundary regex) across all `app/**/*.py`
files. A function with exactly 1 occurrence (the definition line) has no callers
— that is dead-code wiring.

Two exemption sets:
- `_ENTRY_POINTS`: APScheduler callbacks and `main.py` entry points where the
  only reference is the framework registration in the same file.
- `_KNOWN_DEAD`: pre-existing dead code that predates this test. Removing a
  name from here (after fixing the source) is encouraged. Adding a new name
  requires PR justification.

### `test_mypy_suppression_budget.py`

Parses `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` blocks with `ignore_errors = true` from
`pyproject.toml`. Asserts count matches `BASELINE_COUNT` and module names match
`BASELINE_MODULES`. Currently baseline is 0 (no suppressions). Adding a
suppression requires updating both constants with a PR comment explaining the
rationale and a plan for removal.

### `test_model_tier_swap_surface.py`

Two assertions:
1. `setup/model-tiers.json` parses as JSON with exactly `{expensive, medium, cheap, reminder}` keys and non-empty string values.
2. No Python file in `app/` (except `app/models.py`) contains a hardcoded model
   identifier matching `claude-(opus|sonnet|haiku)|gpt-|gemma`.

Pre-existing violations (before this test was introduced) are listed in
`_KNOWN_VIOLATIONS` as `(relative_path, line_number)` pairs. New violations
always fail. Cleaning up a known violation means removing it from both the
source and the set.

### `test_precommit_python_gate.py`

The pre-commit hook (`scripts/run-required-checks.sh pre-commit`) enforces a
Python gate whenever `.py` files are staged: it runs `ruff check` on the staged
paths and then `pytest tests/unit/ -x -q` against the full unit suite. Both
must pass before the commit proceeds. No auto-fix. Setting `HML_SKIP_HOOK_PYTEST=1`
skips the unit suite for dependency-less CI commit contexts (the review-fixer
host commit step uses this); `python-validation.yml`'s `pytest-unit` required
check covers the same suite there, on a read-only runner with the full dependency
set. This test asserts both the default local path (ruff + pytest) and the opt-in
skip path are wired correctly, so neither can silently regress.

### `test_signal_cli_pin.py`

Guards the two-property invariant for `bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api` (bug
class 9 — production dependency pin staleness):

1. `docker/compose.yaml` pins the image by immutable sha256 digest (not a
   mutable tag).
2. `.github/workflows/update-signal-cli.yml` exists, references the same
   image, has a `schedule: cron:` stanza, and validates the registry digest
   before writing it.

The refresh workflow rewrites `docker/compose.yaml` by exact string match on
the image line and by regex on the `# Pinned: <date>` provenance comment.
Both formats are a contract between the two files — reformatting either here
silently breaks the refresh.

Adding a new production image dependency to `docker/compose.yaml` requires
adding a similar two-property lint for that image.

## Regression Directory Convention

```
tests/regressions/
  bug_<NNNN>_<slug>/
    README.md        # Bug story: what broke, why, issue/PR link
    __init__.py
    test_*.py        # At least one test, OR README notes "test lives in ..."
```

`NNNN` is the canonical GitHub issue or PR number (whichever tracks the bug).
The `README.md` must contain a `#NNN` reference. The structural lint
`tests/unit/test_regression_catalog.py` enforces this shape on every PR.

Standalone run: `pytest tests/regressions/bug_0570_reminder_uuid_coercion -v`

Seeded entries (from PR-1):
- `bug_0570_reminder_uuid_coercion/` — full integration test (skips without `DATABASE_URL`)
- `bug_0567_capability_denial/` — README + pointer; test in eval layer (PR-2)

---

## Eval Layer: Fixture Format

Each fixture in `tests/evals/fixtures/<node>/<scenario>.yaml` describes one
model-under-test scenario:

```yaml
id: chat-missed-reminder-001
node: chat
peer: "<test-peer-1>"
inbound: "you didn't remind me - why not?"
prior_state:
  last_reminder_at: "2026-05-26T14:00:00Z"
  active_task_title: "<placeholder>"
tier: medium
contracts:
  - kind: regex_forbid
    pattern: "(?i)(can(not|'t)|not able to)\\s+send\\s+reminders"
  - kind: regex_require
    pattern: "(?i)(missed|did(n'?t| not) (arrive|fire))"
  - kind: judge
    rubric: "Response acknowledges the system DOES send reminders and offers a concrete forward step."
    threshold: 0.7
  - kind: shame_safe
    threshold: 0.8
```

Contract kinds:
- `regex_forbid` / `regex_require` — deterministic; no LLM
- `json_schema` — pydantic validation of structured outputs (intake node)
- `judge` — qualitative rubric scored by a stronger judge LLM (Sonnet 4.6)
- `shame_safe` — judge with fixed ADHD-safety rubric from `design/adhd-priorities.md`

Privacy invariant: all fixtures use placeholder values (`<test-peer>`,
`<placeholder>`, random UUIDs). No real user data in fixtures, commits, or
judge LLM payloads.

Eval layer is PR-2. Per-node fixture coverage target: >= 5 fixtures per node
across 9 nodes (intake, selection, chat, rejection, cannot_finish, need_help,
check_in, complete, classify_intent).

---

## Integration Mock Discipline

Integration tests that mock outbound side effects (Signal send, Notion write,
image gen) must assert the SHAPE of the call, not just the fact of the call.

**Wrong (bug class 3 pattern):**
```python
signal_mock.assert_called()
```

**Right:**
```python
signal_mock.assert_awaited_once()
assert signal_mock.await_args.kwargs["recipient"] == "<test-peer>"
assert signal_mock.await_args.kwargs["attachment_path"] is not None
```

This distinction matters because `assert_called()` passed even when
`signal_client.send_message` was called without an `attachment_path`,
meaning every reward image was silently discarded.

## LLM Swap: How It Works

`app/models.py` reads model tiers from `setup/model-tiers.json` at a path
hardcoded relative to the repo root. No `MODEL_TIERS_PATH` env override exists
in the current runtime. The eval runner swaps model tiers by writing a modified
`setup/model-tiers.json` into the test working tree before invoking the graph
under test. In the eval harness, LangChain routes through a LiteLLM proxy at
`LLM_PROXY_BASE_URL`; LiteLLM dispatches by model alias. The smoke harness
boots the full stack and makes no LLM calls (no real API keys are required —
compose smoke uses placeholder env values).
The production app runtime uses the same proxy configuration.

Model IDs are validated against a known-prefix allowlist (`claude-`, `gemma`,
`gpt-`) at startup. Swapping a tier to any supported alias is a one-line
change in `setup/model-tiers.json`; no Python adapter changes are required.
All LLM routing stays through `app/models.py:llm(tier)`.

Unit tests for provider-boundary behavior must assert the exact `ChatOpenAI`
constructor payload (model id, temperature, base_url, api_key, and
tier-specific `extra_body`) to catch routing regressions that would still pass
a class-assertion-only check. `max_tokens` is tier-conditional: the `cheap`
tier sends it (capped output) and must be asserted; reasoning tiers
(expensive/medium/reminder) omit it and tests must assert its absence. Tests
must assert that the `cheap` tier includes `extra_body={'think': False}` and
that all other tiers do not set `think` unless a deliberate future change adds
it.

Three cost gates for eval runs:
- `ENABLE_LIVE_LLM_EVALS=true` — required for any real LLM call; absent = `pytest.skip`
- `EVAL_MODELS` — explicit comma-separated model alias allowlist; empty = no evals
- `EVAL_BUDGET_USD` — soft cap; runner halts with `pytest.fail("budget exceeded")`

Before running the full eval rig for a model swap, use the **perf harness**
(`tests/perf/`, gated by `ENABLE_LLM_PERF=true`) for a cheap latency + token
comparison. The perf harness measures only speed and token counts — not
behavioral correctness. See `docs/python-rewrite/llm-observability.md`.

## Test Discipline Rules (Developer-Facing)

These are the six contract clauses the test reviewer enforces (see
`.github/scripts/review/prompts/test.md` for the authoritative enforcement spec):

1. **New public function in `app/tools/`, `app/graph/nodes/`, `app/scheduler/`, `app/ingress/`** must have:
   - An integration test asserting reachability from an end-to-end flow.
   - For DB-typed fields (UUID, timestamp, JSON): an integration test with real Postgres round-trip.
   - For outbound side effects: assertion on `mock.call_args.kwargs` shape, not just `mock.called`.

2. **New or modified prompt template in `app/prompts/`** must have:
   - Updated structural test if it adds a new section anchor.
   - New eval fixture if behavior contract changed (new capability statement, new banned phrase).

3. **New migration in `migrations/`** must:
   - Use the next monotonic integer prefix (structural lint enforces this).
   - For schema changes touching code-read columns: include an integration test.

4. **New env var or compose service** must have:
   - Assertion in `tests/smoke/test_compose_round_trip.py` that it's threaded through.
   - Documentation in `docker/compose.yaml` comments.
   - **Exception — CI-only / perf-harness env vars**: `ENABLE_LLM_PERF`, `PERF_MODELS`,
     `PERF_RUNS_N`, and `PERF_RUNS_DIR` are perf-harness-only and are never threaded
     through `docker/compose.yaml`. They are documented in
     `docs/python-rewrite/llm-observability.md` and do not require
     `test_compose_round_trip.py` coverage.

5. **PR fixing a production bug** must add:
   - `tests/regressions/bug_<NNNN>_<slug>/` directory with README citing issue/PR.
   - At least one `test_*.py`, or README note "test lives in ...".

6. **Dropped tests** need explicit PR-body justification. Silent deletion of a failing test is always a blocker.

If this PR adds a new bug class or extends the layer architecture described in
this document, update this document AND update
`.github/scripts/review/prompts/test.md` to enforce the new contract.
